Business Problem : To find out if the US Presidentâ€™s policies/statements are affecting the number of vehicles passing through the border. Manual extraction of trump policies to do text mining and if possible, sentiment analysis. Also, other factors that could affect border immigration are currency exchange rates, oil barrel prices, weather etc. We can also explore increase in number of visa applications.
