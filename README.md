Business Problem : To find out if the US President’s policies/statements are affecting the number of vehicles passing through the border. Manual extraction of trump policies to do text mining and if possible, sentiment analysis. Also, other factors that could affect border immigration are currency exchange rates, oil barrel prices, weather etc. We can also explore increase in number of visa applications.

Backup topics : 
1) Compare Mobile Phone Reviews: Mobiles manufacturers take a lot of pride every year in their flagship phones to meet latest hardware and software demands and to keep their fanbase satisfied. Our idea is to contrast how latest flagship phones of Apple, Google, Samsung, One plus (iPhone 11, Pixel4, Samsung S10+, One plus 7T) were reviewed by experts (tech reviewers, gadget wings of media houses, or companies themselves) and how they worked at ground level with customers. Is the customer sentiment same as the experts? Did they recognize a particular phone’s latest specs? We plan to mine text reviews from media articles for former and customer reviews from amazon for the latter. 
2) Used Car Price Prediction:  In U.S, there are a large number of used car dealers. This is due to the high demand for reasonably priced cars from the middle class and students. Our idea is to predict the price of a used car given the car attributes, weather, auto blog reviews and user reviews. The data has been scraped from kbb.com. For example, given all the car attributes are same,4x4 vehicle would cost more in snowy areas like Utah, Colorado than in California. Contrary, Sedan might have a high value in California. Also, Toyota Camry and Honda Civic would be sold for a better price than a Chevrolet Cruze because of good auto and user reviews. We plan to mine text reviews from autoblog and user reviews of cars and merge it with the cars dataset to predict price of a car with all the given attributes.
