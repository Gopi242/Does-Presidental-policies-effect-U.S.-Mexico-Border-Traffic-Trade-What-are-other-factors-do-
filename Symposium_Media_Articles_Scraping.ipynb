But no country is obliged to take anyone and everyone who wants to enter., Free people have a right to determine, through democratic processes, who can enter and live in their country, and to do so based on their own interests. Despite what Democrats tell you, the public agrees with President Trump in this particular and on immigration in broad terms, even if not in all particulars., More than 70 percent of Americans who watched Trump’s State of the Union speech Tuesday said they favored the basic immigration proposals that the president laid out. These are, first, a path to citizenship for those covered by former President Barack Obama’s policy for “Dreamers,” illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children; second, funding for border security, including a wall; third, reforming the pathways by which immigrants lawfully enter the U.S., This is a good deal, which both parties in Congress should accept., …, It is about time the U.S. returned to using a democratic process to make immigration policy according to reason and self-interest, rather than conducting show trials in the media about which positions are politically correct enough to be espoused in public., …]</td>\n",

They turned away from a golden opportunity to solve this issue. They decided they’d rather come away empty handed, with no resolution whatsoever for the 1.8 million individuals they say they are championing, than accept a reasonable compromise with the president.”,  “On Tuesday the Majority Leader tried twice to open the debate and start voting, but both times there were objections heard by our Democratic colleagues. This despite their repeated promises over the years to address the DACA issue once and for all.”,  “Today is a sad day for many Americans and for many dreamers who would have had a rare pathway to citizenship. We had the opportunity to pass a bill that would have provided legal certainty for 1.8 million individuals. It would have secured the border and focused enforcement on the very worst criminals, like sex offenders, human rights violators and war criminals. And importantly, it had the President’s support and could have actually become law…. It’s unfortunate that so many of my colleagues, when given the chance to finally give citizenship to DACA kids, refused to do so.”,  “President Trump presented a thoughtful framework to accomplish these shared goals and Senator Grassley’s amendment, which I supported, turned that framework into legislation that could become law. Given our mutual goals, it should have passed the Senate in a bipartisan manner. I am disappointed that it did not.”,  “What this debate has shown is just how unserious the Democrats are about illegal immigration. If they were serious, they wouldn’t have shut down the government over DACA only to reject the one bill, endorsed by the president, that would’ve given DACA recipients the legal certainty they need. And they wouldn’t have introduced such a reckless proposal that had zero chance of becoming law. There’s broad agreement about how to solve this problem, but we won’t succeed unless the Democrats stop this incessant virtue-signaling and start negotiating in good faith.”,  “Senate Democrats have shown their true colors. First, they shut down the government over DACA. Today, they had an opportunity to vote to provide certainty for 1.8 million DACA recipients and they voted no. Senate Democrats said they wanted a bipartisan solution, but really they don’t. Senate Democrats said they want to secure our border, but really they don’t. Today, Senate Democrats crushed the dreams of many people who were counting on them to deliver and showed they are quite happy to have an immigration system that does not serve the American people or protect our national security.”,  “In case you didn’t think Congress was absurd before, Senate Democrats are now filibustering the open immigration debate they asked for, and are refusing to put their bill on the floor.”,  “I voted for Senator Grassley’s measure based on President Trump’s proposal. We must stop human trafficking, money laundering and drug trafficking. This amendment provided real border security and discouraged future human trafficking. As a compromise, it also addressed Democrats’ concerns. This was the only bill that could become law. If Democrats truly wished to solve immigration issues, they should have supported this bill.”,  “It is disappointing that a minority of the Senate blocked my bipartisan proposal to end sanctuary cities and protect the safety and security of America.”,  “I voted against the proposal put forward by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer because the Department of Homeland Security said it would not secure the border, nor did it end the diversity lottery system or adequately address chain migration.”,  “Most of what was proposed by the President and Senate Republicans has passed the Senate multiple times over the past fifteen years, but not today. It’s disappointing that Democrats would not come to the table simply because President Trump supported it. Immigration reform is complicated and emotional, but it is essential that we keep working until we reach a good faith solution for the future of all Americans.”,  “I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to reach an agreement today on immigration policy…. It was also deeply troubling that a minority of Senators blocked consideration of my common-sense bipartisan amendment designed to end dangerous sanctuary city policies.”,  “I have said from the beginning that we must secure the border and keep our nation safer, reform our legal immigration system, and find a permanent, compassionate solution for DACA recipients. Today, I voted for measures that would accomplish these things, namely the Secure and Succeed Act and legislation to stop sanctuary cities, and against measures that do not. Democrats continue to try and use Dreamers as a political tool, and we continue working to find a solution.”,  “Trump has shown presidential leadership on immigration. Senate Democrats should take my fellow Tennessean – Howard Baker’s – advice that ‘the other fellow might be right,’ and the other fellow in this case might be named President Trump.”,  “I share the President’s commitment to border security. That’s why I voted for his plan. That’s why I fought to ensure the $25 billion he requested for border security was included in the bipartisan deal. That’s why I opposed the Democratic proposal that did not provide a single penny for border security.”,  “Sad to see that the US Senate could not find any path forward on DACA and immigration reform today. Of interest, Sen Stabenow voted to defund ‘Sanctuary Cities’.”,  “Senate Democrats blocked a vote on #SanctuaryCities. Only further proving that they care more about illegals than actual Americans.”, \\nFox Business’ Trish Regan: “President [Trump] is extending a massive olive branch on immigration, but the Democrats don’t want to make a deal!

       "      <td>[Cabinet Room, \\n3:29 P.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT:  So, thank you all very much — very much for being here.  And a lot of friends in the room.  A lot of great friends.  And, Mr. Vice President, thank you.  And, Secretary Nielsen, thank you very much.  We’re doing a great job on the border, considering we don’t have the tools.  They don’t give us the tools to work with, meaning we have to have a wall.  We have to have a barricade of some kind — a steel barricade.  It’s already designed., We’re building a lot of wall as we speak — a tremendous amount.  And we’re renovating a lot of the other wall.  Otherwise — by the way, with what’s coming up, because of the strong economy that we have — we haven’t had an economy like this, I guess, in over 50 years.  Would you say that’s correct, Steve?, And because of the strong economy, everyone is pouring up, and we’re stopping them.  But it’s a lot of work.  We have incredible people at the border, and you have to thank all of the Border Patrol agents and the ICE agents I see in Long Island.  They don’t want ICE.  The radical Democrats don’t want ICE there because they’re too good; they’re doing too good a job., And I always talk about Long Island; that’s one of the real hotbeds for the MS-13 gangs.  And I just see this morning, where the, really, radical Democrats don’t want them there because they don’t want to do anything to disturb MS-13.  And when you think about it, MS-13 is about the most violent gang, they say; one of the most violent anywhere in the world.  And they have done — we’re sending them out by the thousands out of our country.  So we think it’s too bad., But I would say this: That the State of the Union speech has been cancelled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn’t want to hear the truth.  She doesn’t want the American public to hear what’s going on.  And she’s afraid of the truth.  And the super-left Democrats, the radical Democrats — what’s going on in that Party is shocking.  I know many people that were Democrats and they’re switching over right now, and they’re switching over quickly.  So I hope they know what they’re doing for their Party.  So far, they haven’t.  If you know, I won the Senate — meaning we won the Senate altogether — but we get no credit for that.  They don’t talk about that.  They talk about the House., I didn’t have any chance to — other than a couple of people, like from Kentucky, where I went and campaigned for Andy Barr and for some others, they ended up winning their races.  But I couldn’t campaign too much.  Too many people.  But we did a great job with the Senate, and people don’t want to talk about it., I will say that the American people want to hear the truth.  They have to hear the truth.  And the truth is all about — and said, I think and I hope, well — we were planning on doing a really very important speech in front of the House and the Senate, the Supreme Court, and everybody else that’s there.  It’s called the State of the Union.  It’s in the Constitution.  We’re supposed to be doing it., And now, Nancy Pelosi — or “Nancy,” as I call her — she doesn’t want to hear the truth, and she doesn’t want to hear — more importantly, the American people hear the truth.  So we just found out that she’s cancelled it, and I think that’s a great blotch on the incredible country that we all love.  It’s a great, great, horrible mark.  I don’t believe it’s ever happened before, and it’s always good to be part of history.  But this is a very negative part of history.  This is where people are afraid to open up and say what’s going on.  So it’s a very, very negative part of history., I’d like to start today — we’re talking about shutdown; we’re talking about some conservative values.  These are the great conservative leaders of our country, and they have very strong views.  And we’ll be doing that after the press leaves.  But they have very strong views on the shutdown.  And it’s not that we have a choice.  I don’t think we have a choice.  We have to make our country safe.  We have done such an incredible job with such poor tools.  We have catch-and-release, where you catch somebody and then you have to release that person into our country., We have so many different elements of rule and regulation.  It’s a very sad thing that’s gone on.  And this has happened over a long period of time., If you take a look at the visa lottery — when there’s a lottery, do you think they’re putting their best people into those lotteries?  It’s a lottery.  You know what a lottery is.  Does anybody think they’re putting their best people in?, You have chain migration, where, as an example, the killer — the man who ran over people on the West Side Highway in New York — 8 people killed, 12 injured.  And when you say “12 injured,” nobody knows how badly injured they are.  This isn’t like they had a headache.  This is big, big, and horrible problems.  Loss of legs and arms, and worse.  And this man brought in many people — many, many people — through chain migration, it’s called., So these are all Democrat principles that are no good for our country; they’re hurting our country.  And if we did what we had to do, you would bring crime down in half in our country, because so much of it comes through our southern border., Honduras is doing nothing for us.  Guatemala is doing nothing for us.  El Salvador is doing nothing for us.  And we pay them hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but we’re going to be stopping pretty soon.  In fact, we’re looking at it right now.  We don’t want to do it.  Because when caravans form in the middle of a country, the country can very easily stop those caravans from forming, very easily.  I actually think they encourage the caravans because they want to get rid of the people from their country, and certain people.  A lot of gang members are there.  In the last caravan, we had 618 people with criminal records, and some of them very serious records., I won’t soon forget the man that was interviewed where he wanted some kind of pardon, or whatever, when he came into the country.  And the network person said, “Well, what did you do?”  And he said “murder” or something to that effect.  And she goes, “Whoa, murder.”  Well, we have — that’s what we have.  We have a lot of very dangerous people that want to come into our country.  And we’re not letting them in., We want people to come in based on merit.  We want people to come in that can help us successfully run all these companies that are pouring into the United States because of what we’ve done and because of all of the incentives, Steve, that we’ve given, and because this is where the action is.  Steve Moore is one of the great financial gurus, and he would tell you how well we’re doing as a country., But we have a lot of people that, really, we need.  We have the lowest unemployment rate we’ve had in much more than 50 years, with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American.  We have the lowest unemployment rate we’ve had in the history of our country., And that’s why, when you look at the Hispanic polls, I’m up 19 percent.  And the reason I’m up 19 percent — I don’t even think it’s the unemployment; I think it’s the fact that they understand, better than anybody, what’s going on at the border., And they say that President Trump is the only one that’s saying it right, and he’s doing what you have to.  That’s why people were so surprised when they saw the poll that just came out, where I’m up to 50 percent with the Hispanic and up 19 points in a short period of time.  Because they get it better than anybody at the border.  They know what’s happening at the border and they know it’s a big scam., And the Democrats don’t want to stop people.  That means automatically massive amounts of crime.  And we’re not going to put up with it., So Nancy Pelosi, knowing these facts, and knowing it’s something that she can’t win, that she just went out and said, let’s cancel — for the first time in the history of our country — “Let’s cancel the State of the Union Address.”  And it’s a disgrace.  Just so you know, she uses on the basis of the shutdown.  But when she asked me to make the address — formally, in writing; most of you have a copy of the letter — when she asked me to make the address, she did it during the shutdown — well into the shutdown, by a couple of weeks., So the shutdown was going on.  Now she’s blaming the shutdown.  So if it was because of the shutdown, why do you ask that the address be made?  And she asked that the address be made during a shutdown, and now she’s blaming the shutdown., She also knew — because she went to our people and she asked, “Would it be a security problem?”  She knew it wasn’t a security problem.  She blamed security, but she knew it wasn’t a security problem, and she knew that loud and clear., And she went to the people.  She asked.  They said, “We have no problem whatsoever.”  I just got back from Iraq.  I was very safe in Iraq, and I felt very safe.  We had great, great security.  If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington in a very, very spectacular building, and a beautiful room that we should be in, and that’s where it’s been for a very long time., So it’s a sad thing for our country.  We’ll do something in the alternative.  We’ll be talking to you about that at a later date., But I have to say, it’s an honor to have these great leaders with us, and we’re going to be talking about shutdown.  We’re going to be talking about other things.  And we’re going to be talking about — outside of this event that we just discussed — how well our country is doing, because we’re setting records in so many different ways.  We’re setting jobs records., Right now, at this very moment, we have more people working in the United States than at any time in the history of our country.  Think of that.  That’s a big, big statement.  I just had a meeting on drug pricing and various other things.  And prescription drugs, for the first time in history — the history of our country — have gone down in 2018., So for last year — just got the numbers — for the first time in the history of our country, prescription drug prices have gone down.  They’ve been like a rocket ship until I got here.  And we have more to do.  They’re going to go down further.  But think of that: For the first time — I say it because you guys don’t want to report it, but that’s a big thing, because drug pricing has been very important to me, as is healthcare., First time in the history of our country, in 2018, prescription drug prices have gone down.  That’s a big number.  And you didn’t even know that.  I don’t think anybody at this table knew that.  It just came out.  So we’ll let you know., So it’s too bad with Nancy Pelosi, what she’s done.  It’s radical Democrats.  They’ve become a radicalized party.  They really have.  They have become a radicalized party.  I actually think they’ve become a very dangerous party for this country.  If you listen to what they’re saying, what they’re doing, I think they’ve become a very dangerous — a very, very dangerous party for this country., I think that Chuck Schumer, sadly, is dominated by the radical left, and he is dominated by Nancy Pelosi.  Very strongly dominated.  He can’t move; he’s a puppet.  He’s a puppet for Nancy Pelosi, if you can believe that.  But that’s what’s become and that’s what’s happening., And we’re not going to let it happen to our nation, and we are not going to allow the radical left to control our borders.  Because if they do, you will see crime; you will see drugs; you will see human trafficking like you have never seen ever in the history of our country.  You will never see anything like what you would see.  So we will never let the radical left control our borders., Thank you very much.  Thank you., Q    Mr. President, are you not giving the speech on Tuesday night?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll be announcing what we’re doing., Q    Sir, she said it’s not cancelled but that she wants to come to an agreeable date.  So, will you agree to a new date?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see.  We’ll see.  Well, it wouldn’t be very hard, but that’s not what she means.  And it’s very sad.  I think it’s a very, very bad thing for our country, and it’s a horrible precedent.  And we have many positive things to say, but we also have things that we want to turn into positives that are big negatives., The southern border is a very, very big deal.  It should’ve been handled by other Presidents for many times, just like Israel with the — if you look, moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  Every President talked about it; nobody did it until I came along.  Same thing in a certain, different way with the southern border.  It should’ve been stopped a long time ago.  They talked about it.  They had approvals for doing it, and they were unable to pull it off.  Other Presidents should’ve done this.  We’re going to do it.  And it’s not because I want to, it’s because I have no choice.  Because if we don’t do it, this country is going to be worse than any — at any time in our history in terms of drug infestation and in terms of crime.  And our crime numbers are really good, but our crime numbers would be very much better if we had a stopped-up southern border., And, by the way, the caravan now, they’re saying, is massive.  The caravan that’s coming up.  Thank you very much, Honduras.  We send Honduras hundreds of millions of dollars, and they send us caravans.  The three of those countries., And, you know, as I said, we’re probably going to be stopping that.  We’re working on that right now.  I would stop it.  Because, you know, you have two theories: You can give more and let them do economic development, or you can do less.  I’m of the less theory.  I don’t think we should give anything to them., And we’ve done this with numerous countries over the world where they’re not treating us right.  We have countries that get hundreds of millions of dollars — they don’t even vote for us at the United Nations, until we say we’re not going to pay you anymore, and then they immediately vote for us.  So, you know, but that’s not a — I don’t call that a vote., So I want to thank everybody very much.  We’re going to have a great meeting.  And we will have a response to Nancy Pelosi in due course.  But what she’s doing to the American people, what she is doing to our Constitution, is a disgrace.  Thank you very much., Thank you very much everybody., END                3:44 P.M.

EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Good to have you all.  Hello, Chairman.  Great man, right here.  Might be another one right there.  We have some good ones.  We had a wonderful meeting on healthcare, yesterday, you probably know about, and so we’re moving along.  Hello, Thomas., Thank you very much for being here to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital safety and national security legislation., We’re joined by the Chairman of the House Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte, a friend of mine for a long time.  Bob is one of the most skilled legislators in Congress — and you didn’t even tell me to say that, Bob, right — (laughter) — and he’s worked with law enforcement to write a series of critical immigration bills that will close the dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, terrorists., MS-13 is a prime target.  They are bad people.  And we’ve gotten many of them out already.  You know, we’re pretty much at the 50 percent mark.  We’re getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we’re freeing up towns.  We’re actually liberating towns, if you can believe that we have to do that in the United States of America.  But we’re doing it, and we’re doing it fast., Also with us today are Congressman Peter King, another friend.  Lou Barletta — where’s Lou?  Lou, another friend.  So you’re running for governor, Lou?  Look behind you, Lou.  You can make a big announcement — (laughter.)  Lou Barletta, an early supporter.  Thank you, Lou.  And David Young., Tomorrow, the House will vote on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.  It’s been in the works for a long time.  People have wanted it, Bob, for a long time.  But we were able to get this process going, and I hope you’re going to be successful.  You’ll be successful, tomorrow, with the vote?, REPRESENTATIVE GOODLATTE:  We will., THE PRESIDENT:  Good — which will cut federal grant money to cities that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to federal law enforcement., The House will also vote on Kate’s Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant and who’s been deported five times.  This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly reenter the country illegally., Countless innocent Americans, including the loved ones of many families in the room — and many of these families are friends of mine — great friends of mine that I got to know over the campaign trail because they fought so hard for this.  And they are with us.  They’ve had members of their family killed by illegal immigrants and, really, people with multiple — in some cases, multiple deportations., I’m especially honored to be here with so many courageous families whom I did get to know so well over the past period of time.  You know, here’s one right over here.  Jamiel — a great, great man with a great son — great son, great family., You lost the people that you love because our government refused to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.  And that’s even the existing immigration laws, without new laws.  That’s existing immigration laws., For years, the pundits, journalists, politicians in Washington refused to hear your voices, but on Election Day, 2016, your voices were heard all across the entire world.  Right?  You better believe it.  Nobody died in vain, I can tell you., Chairman Goodlatte has produced a package of truly key immigration enforcement bills.  We’ve been waiting for these for a long time, and I want to thank you, Chairman, for doing that.  Great job.  And it’s just perfect., This package includes the Davis-Oliver Act, whose passage I called for nearly a year ago at my inauguration speech and immigration speech — both — the immigration speech taking place in Phoenix, Arizona.  The Davis-Oliver Act was named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, who were gunned down in the line of duty by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.  And everybody knew this person was big, big trouble, and they begged law enforcement to get him out.  And they were unable to do that., Their incredibly brave widows honored — and they’re here with us, by the way — we’re honoring them today.  And it’s honored — where are you please?  The widow — where is — they’re here someplace.  In the back of the room?  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you., We’re privileged to be joined by Melissa.  Melissa —, MS. OLIVER:  Right here., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what I thought.  Hello, Melissa.  (Laughter.)  Melissa Oliver.  And I just want to say that your father was a true hero — and you know that — and a great gentleman, and we miss him.  You miss him.  We miss him., We’re calling on all members of Congress to honor grieving American families by passing these lifesaving measures in the House, in the Senate, and then sending them to my desk for a very rapid signature.  I promise you, it will be done quickly.  You don’t have to wait the mandatory period.  It will be very quick, Melissa, in honor of your father and others, okay?  And in honor of Jamiel., MR. SHAW:  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  It’s time to support our police, to protect our families, and to save American lives.  And also to start getting smart., So with that, I’d like to ask each of the families invited, and some of the folks that I know that — and some I’ve gotten to know so well.  I’d like to start with Jamiel, to tell just a quick story about how great your son was, perhaps what happened, so that other people can learn by it.  I mean, your son was an incredible young man, incredible student and athlete.  Tell us about your son, Jamiel., END, \\n3:14 P.M.

       "      <td>[The President’s Weekly Address is now available to watch on , , , , and , ., My Fellow Americans,, Protecting the safety and well-being of American Citizens is my highest duty as President. Yet, lawless sanctuary jurisdictions are nullifying federal law, obstructing immigration enforcement, and releasing thousands of criminal aliens into U.S. communities to prey on innocent victims. It’s absolutely terrible., For example, in recent days, San Francisco officials denied ICE’s request to turn over a criminal alien with a prior conviction for battery and a charge for driving under the influence., In another city in California, local law enforcement recently denied ICE’s request to turn over a criminal alien convicted of Sexual Battery who had a history of domestic violence. A truly violent person., And last week, the mayor of Oakland warned criminal aliens of a coming ICE enforcement action – giving them time to scatter and hide from authorities.  The mayor’s conduct directly threatened the safety of federal immigration officers and the law-abiding Americans in her community., The State of California is sheltering dangerous criminals in a brazen and lawless attack on our Constitutional system of government.  Every state in our Union is subject to the laws and Constitution of the United States – including California.  Yet California’s leaders are in open defiance of federal law. They don’t care about crime. They don’t care about death and killings. They don’t care about robberies. They don’t care about the kind of things that you and I care about., In other recent cases, New York authorities released illegal aliens who were previously charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon, possession of poisonous drugs, and strangling a person – in each case, New York officials had refused to turn these dangerous illegal aliens over to ICE or notify ICE about their release with enough time for them to be safely arrested., Just this week, the city of Denver refused ICE’s request to turn over a criminal illegal alien charged with vehicular homicide for killing another driver in a horrific hit-and-run., Sanctuary jurisdictions are the best friend of smugglers, gang members, drug dealers, human traffickers, killers, and other violent offenders., We want our cities to be sanctuaries for Americans, not safe havens for criminals. That is why I am calling on Congress to block funds for jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminals., It is time to end the bloodshed brought about by reckless sanctuary policies – and it is time to save American lives and American cities., Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[The President’s Weekly Address is now available to watch on , , , , and , ., My fellow Americans,, This week, prosecutors, law enforcement officers, homeland security officials, and lawmakers joined me at the White House to address a very vicious threat to our communities—the savage gang, MS-13., Glaring loopholes in our laws have allowed criminals and gang members to break into our country. For example, under current law, unaccompanied alien minors at the border are released into American communities no matter where, no matter how, it is so easy for them because the laws are bad and they have to be changed. This loophole is easily exploited by MS-13, which now operates in at least 40 states., In addition to MS-13, many other gangs are breaking into our country routinely because our laws are so weak, so sad, so pathetic., At this week’s roundtable, we learned the story of one family right here in Washington, D.C. that hosted a person in their home, who then began to recruit their young son to MS-13. When the boy’s mother tried to stop it, the gang member shot her in the head, blinding her for life. She’s lucky she lived, but she’s paying a very big price., During my State of the Union, I called on Congress to immediately close dangerous loopholes in federal law that have endangered our communities and imposed enormous burdens on U.S. taxpayers., My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Chain migration is a disaster and very unfair to our country. The visa lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place. People enter a lottery to come into our country. What kind of a system is that? It is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans. Every member of Congress should choose the side of law enforcement, and the side of the American People. That’s the way it has to be.]</td>\n",

EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, CUNA!  (Applause.)  And I want to say thank you to Jim Nussle.  Thank you for your kind introduction.  He’s been my friend of many years.  In our time together in the United States Congress, he served with great distinction as our Budget Chairman.  He served an administration as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  And now leading this vital organization in the life of this nation, Jim Nussle has made a difference expanding opportunities for American families.  Would you join me in thanking my friend, Jim Nussle, for his great leadership?  (Applause.), And it’s an honor to be here with all of you men and women who work hard every day to help Americans achieve the American Dream for their families, for their businesses.  You build local communities.  Credit unions are a part of everything good that is happening in cities large and small across this country.  And it’s my great honor to be here at the 2019 Government Affairs Conference of the Credit Union National Association.  Thank you so much for welcoming me here today.  (Applause.), And I want to give a special welcome to some great friends of mine from my time in the Congress, my time as a governor of the great state of Indiana.  We’ve got some Hoosiers in the house.  (Applause.)  John McKenzie, Dave Abernathy, all of you who are here with the Indiana Credit Union League: I am just delighted to see you all again., And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a great friend of credit unions and a great friend of all of you, and a man whose leadership has revived the economy of the United States of America.  I bring greetings from President Donald Trump to each and every one of you.  (Applause.), And I’m here today, on the President’s behalf and on behalf of our entire administration, really just to say, “thank you.”  Thanks to all of you for the vital role that you play in our nation, for the work you do to help millions of Americans build stronger families and build stronger businesses and stronger communities., The truth is, people that know members of this great association know you make it possible for American families to buy that next car, to send a child to college, buy that dream home.  You make it possible for countless entrepreneurs to start a small business and to help drive our economy., The men and women who run America’s credit unions — each one of you and all those you represent — you really do incredible work every day.  There’s really too many stories to tell today, but let me mention a few., Sara DeLance is here from Rutland, Vermont.  Sara, are you in the house?  (Applause.)  Fifteen years ago, I’m told, Sara took her first job as a part-time teller at her local credit union.  But today, because of her hard work, skill, and determination, Sara is a Senior Vice President at Heritage Family Credit Union.  And just last year, she was recognized for her outstanding service when Sara was named one of Vermont Business Magazine’s Rising Stars.  Now let’s hear it for Sara.  (Applause.), I’m also told that with us today is Maurice Smith, CEO of the Local Government Federal Credit Union in Raleigh, North Carolina.  In more than two decades of experience with credit unions, Maurice has earned many awards for his success.  But the impact of his work reaches far beyond the balance sheet., I’m actually told that Maurice makes a special effort to help credit union members whose incomes are more modest, like all of you do every single week across the country.  He treats every one of his clients, I’m told, as if they were his only client.  In fact, a longtime member of Maurice’s credit union recently said that, even years after she first joined, she, in her words, still feels like she’s the credit union’s “most important member.”, That’s the difference the personal impact — the personal touch that America’s credit unions make every single day in communities across America.  And I know each one of you are emblematic of that outstanding service., So join me in thanking Sara, Maurice, and every single one of you and your employees for your care and your diligence on behalf of the communities you serve.  (Applause.), It really is remarkable to think about the difference that credit unions make nationwide.  You serve 115 million Americans, with more than a stunning $1 trillion worth of loans., Over the past two years, you’ve also stood by the side of this President and this administration as we’ve fought to advance a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda., And just as we’re grateful to have you as our allies, you can be assured: The American credit unions have no greater champion than President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)  It’s true., You know, over the past two years, President Trump has signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history.  (Applause.)  Since Election Day, we’ve actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and business owners.  And, as all of you know, that also included their fundamental reform of the Dodd-Frank law.  (Applause.), As all of you know, Dodd-Frank restricted your members’ choices that limited the freedom of the American people to make financial decisions that were the best for them., Dodd-Frank made Washington bureaucrats more powerful and less accountable, giving them ever-more control over the work that you do every single day., It was, in every sense, a failed law that resulted in tens of thousands of pages of burdensome regulation — a mountain of red tape that created a tremendous burden on America’s credit unions and ultimately on the families and businesses that you serve., Since Dodd-Frank was passed into law nine years ago, the number of credit unions in America actually declined by more than 25 percent.  It was an average loss of one credit union each day., That’s why President Trump took action.  And with the support of majorities in the Congress, this President signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act into law, rolling back some of Dodd-Frank’s most damaging regulations.  (Applause.)  And you all were a part of that.  And your support in that effort made a tremendous difference, and you have our thanks on behalf of the American people that you serve., Now, credit unions understand the needs of your members far better than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. ever will.  And you showed that in the fight for that reform.  And under President Trump’s leadership, I want to promise you: Under this administration, we are going to continue to empower you to do what you do best: serving your members and serving growing communities across America.  (Applause.), But the truth is, we haven’t just been rolling back red tape on institutions like yours and on businesses large and small.  Under this President’s leadership, we’ve unleashed American energy as well — the lifeblood of our economy that fuels small businesses and family farms that credit unions support so much.  And thanks to our actions today, and thanks to the leadership of this President and the ingenuity of American energy entrepreneurs, today the United States is the world’s largest producer of oil and natural gas.  And next year, we will be a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years.  (Applause.), Under this President’s leadership, we’re also forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.  From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we’re negotiating deals that are free, fair, and reciprocal so working families and business owners can serve and can compete on the world stage., And, of course, with the support of all of you in this room and people all across the country, this President kept his promise to the American people before our first year was out when he signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history.  (Applause.), With the strong support of credit unions and your members around the country, we cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, family farms, and businesses of every size that credit unions serve.  And we made it possible for families and businesses to keep more of what they earn.  And the results of this agenda, as I’m sure you’ve witnessed on Main Street America, has been nothing short of extraordinary., Since Election Day, businesses large and small across America, in cities and towns, have seen businesses create 5.3 million new jobs, including 490,000 manufacturing jobs.  The American economy is roaring again.  (Applause.), Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.  And today, unemployment has hit a nearly 50-year low.  We’ve actually seen the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.  The truth is, the American Dream is working for every American once again, and credit unions are a part of making that happen.  (Applause.), It’s amazing to think more Americans are working today than ever before in our nation’s history.  A growing economy means more money for the families that you serve.  Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.  And it’s truly meaningful to the President and me that the most rapid growth of wages in America today is among blue-collar workers, the backbone of America.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  (Applause.), So we’ve made great progress.  The American economy is booming, and you all are a part of that extraordinary story of progress.  But as we gather here today in our nation’s capital, I want to assure you: In this administration, we understand that security is the foundation of our prosperity.  That’s why our administration has taken decisive action from our very first days to promote the safety and security of the American people., Yesterday, President Trump submitted his budget request to the Congress.  It called for fiscal discipline in discretionary domestic programs and a record investment in national defense and border security., As the President has said many times, “If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country.”, So as I stand before you today, all of you gathered here from all 50 states across this country, you deserve to know — whatever you hear in the national media — the truth is, we have a crisis on our southern border.  It’s a crisis of illegal immigration, drugs, dangerous criminals, and human trafficking.  And you also deserve to know that it’s a crisis like we’ve never seen before., For the first time ever, a majority of people attempting to come into our country through our southern border illegally are families and unaccompanied minors that are being enticed to make the long and dangerous journey from Central America by drug cartels and human traffickers who take advantage of our porous border and loopholes in our laws to encourage people to pay cash to be taken up to our border., As the President has said, in his words, “These are heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings…on both sides of the border.”, The truth is, 70 percent of illegal immigrants report being victims of violence on their journey to our southern border.  And according to Doctors Without Borders, nearly one-third of women traveling to our southern border report being sexually assaulted on the journey., Now, just last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced that, in the last five months alone, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of families apprehended compared to the same period one year ago.  My fellow Americans, every day we don’t secure our border, we are allowing the crisis to worsen and more lives to be endangered and exploited., And despite the incredible work that our men and women in law enforcement are doing, drug cartels and smugglers are exploiting this crisis at our southern border to flood drugs into our country, harming our children and our families and the communities where you live and lead., It’s heartbreaking to acknowledge that, today, drug overdose is the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age.  In 2016, all across America, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day., These statistics don’t tell the story better than I know you already know it, because I know the role that credit unions play in your communities.  You’re involved in every worthy cause, in every charity.  You are an integral part of your communities.  And so when the stories are told of heartbreak, you’ve already heard those stories., A member of the United States Senate from the American northwest told me not long ago — he said, “Mike, I’m standing strong with the President for border security.”  He said, “Because we don’t have a crisis on our southern border.”  He said, “We have a crisis in all 50 states of opiate abuse and addiction, and it’s time for America to act.”  (Applause.), The crisis on our southern border is affecting us all.  It’s affecting every community in America.  That’s why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security, declared a national emergency on our southern border., Despite the fact that he has clear statutory authority under the National Emergencies Act, some in Congress are actually trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress gave him to address what is an undeniable humanitarian crisis on our southern border., Now, we’re grateful for senators who are working to find a way to address this crisis and support the President’s emergency declaration for border security.  And after I leave you today, I’ll travel to Capitol Hill to continue those discussions., But let me say this: A vote against the President’s emergency declaration is a vote against border security.  A vote against the President’s emergency declaration is a vote to deny the real humanitarian and security crisis that is happening at our southern border., And so we’re calling on every member of the United States Senate: Set politics aside.  Stand up for border security.  Stand with this President.  And put the safety and security of the American people first.  (Applause.), And I know many of you are headed to Capitol Hill in the days ahead.  When I was a member of Congress, I always looked forward to my credit union leaders coming in.  I know you’ll be talking about economic issues in your community.  But you serve families.  It’s one of the things that makes credit unions so special., And so I encourage each one of you, as you meet with representatives in the House and Senate, just encourage them to take a stand for border security.  Encourage them to stand with this President as he’s taking such decisive action to secure our border., And once we’ve secured our border, I promise you we will work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system once and for all.  (Applause.)  We’ll do it., So as I close, let me just say “thank you” once again to all of you for all you’ve done to bring opportunities and prosperity to American families., I know what you do.  You know, I’m a small-town guy from southern Indiana.  I know the difference that credit unions make in communities large and small across this country.  In my hometown, you know, there was never a Little League Baseball game, there was a never a high school function, there was never a local charity, or a church event where you didn’t see the local credit union banner hanging back on the fence.  You all are always there and you make a difference.  And you’re to be commended for that., And in the days ahead, I just want to assure you that we’re going to keep working to make sure this nation continues to grow and thrive; that you continue to sit down with those members and help them achieve their dreams for themselves and for their family, and their children and their children’s children., And at this time in the life of our nation, I have to tell you, the work that each one of us are doing couldn’t be more important.  And, frankly, the choice we face couldn’t be clearer.  You know, it is remarkable to think — as we gather in the midst of this extraordinary prosperity, in the most prosperous nation on Earth, built on free enterprise, built on that American Dream — many of the leading voices in the other party are actually advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world., Under the guise of what’s called Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, liberals in Washington and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and have stifled the liberties of millions.  That system is socialism., The truth is, what they’re actually offering is more — just more of the same: more government, more taxes, more spending, and less freedom., The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none.  And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it’s going to cost all of us if they ever pass it into law.  (Applause.), You know, Margaret Thatcher had it right.  She said, quote, “The trouble with Socialism is [you] eventually run out of other people’s money.”  (Applause.), You know, President Trump said it well in his State of the Union Address.  He said, “America was founded on liberty and independence, and not [on] government coercion, domination, and control.”  (Applause.), And so in the days ahead, I urge each and every one of you who make the American Dream happen, go out there and also tell members why it’s happening.  It’s because of freedom, free enterprise that gives us the opportunity to live our dreams., I believe with all my heart the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment that America ceases to be America.  So we must say, with one voice, as President Trump said before the Congress, “America will never be a socialist country.”  (Applause.), So to all the leaders gathered here today: Thank you again.  Thank you for what each and every one of you do to come alongside families in your communities, to be there and to strengthen everything that makes America strong and prosperous.  You stand alongside hardworking people that are living the American Dream.  You build great communities., And I just encourage you in the days ahead, whether it be standing for border security or standing up for those timeless American ideals, let you voice be heard., And I’ll promise you, the President and I are going to keep on fighting for all the principles and policies that you’ve supported not just over the last two years, but as so many of you have supported throughout your lifetimes and the lifetime of this movement., The truth is, it’s going to take all of us in the days ahead to keep America growing, to keep America on the pathway of the principles that are restoring American greatness each and every day., And so I want to encourage each and every one of you, as I go, to let your voice be heard not just on Capitol Hill this week, but when you go back home.  Recognize that you’re leaders in your community., You know, I’ll always believe that all the cable TV shows in the world, all of the social media, all the mail pieces and TV ads in political campaigns don’t matter a hill of beans than when somebody that you know and respect in a community speaks up about issues that are important to your family, or to the community, or the state or the nation.  So we encourage you, just let your voice be heard in the days ahead., And lastly, just continue to stand with those families. I’ve seen it firsthand.  It has always been touching to me that credit unions don’t have clients; you have members.  They’re communities, and they’re born of the great tradition of associations that’s always been the heart of America.  People coming together to find solutions with one another, to build on the principles of free enterprise and opportunity and individual responsibility., And so just keep doing what you’re doing.  Keep believing in the communities that you’re serving.  Keep believing in those people that come in nervously with their hands wringing, and they sit across the table from you and they tell you about their dream.  And keep investing in the American Dream., In a word: Have faith.  Have faith that, when given the opportunity and the freedom, the American people demonstrate each and every day that this is a nation where dreams come true.  Credit union members make that happen.  But also, I encourage you to continue to demonstrate the faith that I’ve seen characterized in so many credit union leaders over the years, and faith that each and every one of us are precious in the sight of God.  Each and every one of us, when given the opportunity, can achieve our dreams., Because those words written so long ago are still just as true today for each and every person you meet.  They’re over the mantle in our house at the Vice President’s Residence, and they continue to guide our little family.  For I know the plans I have for you — plans to prosper you, not to harm you; plans to give you a hope and a future., With faith in Him who promises a hope and a future to all our people, I say “thank you.”  Thank you for your service.  Keep up the great work.  And God Bless you all.  (Applause.), END, 10:50 A.M.

       "      <td>[Cabinet Room, 11:39 A.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, everyone, for being here.  I’m thrilled to be with a distinguished group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers from both the House and the Senate.  We have something in common, we’d like to see this get done, and you know what this means., We are here today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves the needs of the American families, workers, and taxpayers.  It’s DACA.  We’ve been talking about DACA for a long time.  I’ve been hearing about it for years, long before I decided to go into this particular line of work.  And maybe we can do something., We have a lot of good people in this room.  A lot of people that have a great spirit for taking care of the people we represent — we all represent.  For that reason, any legislation on DACA, we feel — at least a strong part of this group feels — has to accomplish three vital goals., And Chairman Goodlatte will be submitting a bill over the next two to three days that will cover many of the things.  And, obviously, that will — if it gets passed, it will go to the Senate and we can negotiate and we’ll see how it turns out.  But I feel having the Democrats in with us is absolutely vital because it should be a bipartisan bill.  It should be a bill of love.  Truly, it should be a bill of love, and we can do that., But it also has to be a bill where we’re able to secure our border.  Drugs are pouring into our country at a record pace and a lot of people are coming in that we can’t have.  We’ve greatly stiffened, as you know, and fewer people are trying to come in., But we have tremendous numbers of people and drugs pouring into our country., So, in order to secure it, we need a wall.  We need closing enforcement — we have to close enforcement loopholes.  Give immigration officers — and these are tremendous people, the border security agents, the ICE agents — we have to give them the equipment they need, we have to close loopholes, and this really does include a very strong amount of different things for border security., I think everybody in the room would agree to that.  I think that we — it’s a question of the amounts.  But I think everyone agrees we have to have border security.  I don’t think there would be anybody that says “no.”, Second, it has to be a bill to end chain migration.  Chain migration is bringing in many, many people with one, and often it doesn’t work out very well.  Those many people are not doing us right.  And I think a lot of people in the room — and I’m not sure I can speak for everybody, but a lot of the people in this room want to see chain migration ended., And we have a recent case along the West Side Highway, having to do with chain migration, where a man ran over — killed eight people and many people injured badly.  Loss of arms, loss of legs.  Horrible thing happened, and then you look at the chain and all of the people that came in because of him.  Terrible situation., And the other is — cancel the lottery program.  They call it “visa lottery,” I just call it “lottery.”  But countries come in and they put names in a hopper.  They’re not giving you their best names; common sense means they’re not giving you their best names.  They’re giving you people that they don’t want.  And then we take them out of the lottery.  And when they do it by hand — where they put the hand in a bowl — they’re probably — what’s in their hand are the worst of the worst., But they put people that they don’t want into a lottery and the United States takes those people.  And again, they’re going back to that same person who came in through the lottery program.  They went — they visited his neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood said, “oh my God, we suffered with this man — the rudeness, the horrible way he treated us right from the beginning.”  So we don’t want the lottery system or the visa lottery system.  We want it ended., So those three things are paramount.  These are measures that will make our community safer and more prosperous.  These reforms are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans.  They’re from every standpoint, from every poll, and they’re being requested by law enforcement officers., I had the big meeting with ICE last week; I had a big meeting with the Border Patrol agents last week.  Nobody knows it better than them.  As an example, on the wall, they say, “sir, we desperately need the wall.”, And we don’t need a 2,000-mile wall.  We don’t need a wall where you have rivers and mountains and everything else protecting it.  But we do need a wall for a fairly good portion.  We also — as you know, it was passed in 2006 — a essentially similar thing, which — a fence, a very substantial fence was passed.  But, unfortunately, I don’t know, they never got it done.  But they need it., So I’m appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party, and to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and let’s see if we can get something done.  I really think that we have a chance to do it.  I think it’s very important.  You’re talking about 800,000 people — and we’re talking about lots of other people are also affected, including people that live in our country.  That’s from the security standpoint., So maybe the press can stay for a little while and a couple of folks can make statements and I don’t mind the statements.  We want to have this as a very open forum.  I will say, though, that I really do believe Democratic and Republican — the people sitting around this table — want to get something done in good faith.  And I think we’re on our way to do it., This was an idea I had last week.  I was sitting with some of our great Republican senators and we all agreed on everything.  It was a great meeting.  Right?  David, right?  We had a great meeting — Tom.  It was perfect., Then I said, “yeah, but we’d like to get some Democrats.  Well, what do they say?”  And I say, “let’s have the same meeting, but let’s add the Democrats.”  And that’s what we’ve done.  And I think we’re going to come up with an answer.  I hope we’re going to come up with an answer for DACA, and then we go further than that later on down the road., Dick, perhaps you’d like to say a few words?, SENATOR DURBIN:  Thanks, Mr. President, for inviting us.  We’re all honored to be a part of this conversation., September the 5th, you challenged us.  You challenged Congress.  You said we’re going to end DACA, not replace it.  As of today, we have not done that.  We face a deadline of March 5th, which you created with your elimination of DACA, and we know that, in the meantime, there have been efforts underway by Senator Graham and I., We sat down with a bipartisan group of senators.  We have worked long and hard, many hours have been put into it.  And we feel that we can put together a combination for the future of DACA as well as border security, and that there are elements you’re going to find Democrats support when it comes to border security.  We want a safe border in America, period, both when it comes to the issues of illegal migration, but also when it comes to drugs and all these other areas., Now, I will say that there is a sense of urgency that’s felt by many of us when it comes to this issue.  There are many of these young people who are losing the protection of DACA on a daily basis.  As of March 5th, a thousand a day will lose DACA protection.  Nine hundred of them are members of the U.S. military.  Twenty thousand of them are schoolteachers.  In my state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, there are 25 of them in medical school who can’t apply for a residency if they lose their DACA status., So lives are hanging in the balance of our getting the job done.  We’ve got the time to do it.  In a matter of days — literally of days — we can come together and reach an agreement.  And when that happens, I think good things will happen in other places.  And we’ll see some progress in Washington., THE PRESIDENT: I agree with that, Dick.  I very much agree with that.  Tom, would you like to say something?  Tom Cotton., SENATOR COTTON:  Thank you for inviting us all here and I’m glad to be here with Democrats and with House members as well.  You know, I think, on this issue, there’s a lack of trust and has been, for many years, a lack of trust between Republicans and Democrats; a lack of trust among Republicans; most fundamentally, a lack of trust between the American people and our elected leaders on not delivering a solution for many, many years about some of these problems., And I hope that this meeting can be the beginning of building trust between our parties, between the chambers, because I know, for fact, all the Republicans around the table are committed to finding a solution, and I believe all the Democrats are as well., So I think this is a good first step in building the trust we need for a good bill, Mr. President, that will achieve the objectives that you stated: providing legal protection for the DACA population, while also securing our border and ending chain migration and the diversity lottery., Thank you for the invitation., REPRESENTATIVE HOYER:  Mr. President, thank you very much for having us down here.  I agree with Tom Cotton that the American public are very frustrated with us.  One of the reasons they’re frustrated with us is because we continue to couple things on which we have large agreement with things in which we do not agree.  This is a perfect example of that., Eighty-six percent of the American people in the most recent poll are for ensuring, as you have said, not providing for DACA-protected kids to go to a place that they don’t know, they didn’t grow up in, and it’s not their home.  They’re Americans.  They don’t have a piece of paper that says they’re Americans, but they’re Americans., And it seems to me, Mr. President, if we’re going to move ahead in a constructive way, that we take that on which we agree — pass it.  The American public will be pleased with all of us if we do that.  Just as, in September, you recall, we did the extension of the CR.  No drama.  We were all for it.  You and the four leaders met, we came to an agreement, and we passed that CR., In my view, we can pass the protection in the — well, I understand your position is procedurally it was not done correctly.  You then, as Dick has said, challenged us — pass it correctly., If it’s put on the floor, Mr. President, I believe we will have the overwhelming majority in both the House — and Senator Graham thinks that we’ll have a substantial majority in the United States Senate as well.  That, I think, is the first step, Tom, to creating some degree of confidence., Democrats are for security at the borders; I want to state that emphatically.  There is not a Democrat that is not for having secure borders., There are obviously differences however, Mr. President, on how you effect that.  You just indicated that yourself.  And you indicated this would be a first step, and then we continue to talk as we’re talking today about how we best secure the border.  There are differences of opinion within your party and within in our party., So I would urge that we move forward on protecting the DACA-protected individuals — young people, young adults, as you pointed out in one of your statements — who are productive parts of our community — that we protect them and get that done.  And then, because I think everybody around the table, as you pointed out, is for security — and then the issue is going to be how do we best effect that border security., So I would urge us to move, as Senator Durbin has urged us to move, on the DACA students.  As a matter of fact, the Speaker, I think today, but maybe yesterday, said, we need to solve the DACA issue, and we need to solve it in a way that is permanent, not temporary.  And I agree with him on that issue., THE PRESIDENT:  And, interestingly, when you say that, President Obama, when he signed the executive order, actually said he doesn’t have the right to do this.  And so you do have to go through Congress, and you do have to make it permanent, whether he does, whether he doesn’t — let’s assume he doesn’t, he said it — and that was a temporary stopgap, I don’t think we want that.  I think we want to have a permanent solution to this.  And I think everybody in this room feels that way very strongly., REPRESENTATIVE HOYER:  What happened, Mr. President, I think, is that the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill, as you know.  We did not consider it in the House, so we didn’t reach those issues., Very frankly, on border security, Mr. McCaul, the Chairman of the committee, reported out a unanimous security solution, which we then included in the bill that we filed on comprehensive immigration reform.  So I think we can reach agreement., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I also think that, after we do DACA — and I really believe we should be able to be successful — I really think we should look in terms of your permanent solution and to the whole situation with immigration.  I think a lot of people in this room would agree to that also, but we’ll do it in steps.  And most people agree with that, I think, that we’ll do the steps.  Even you say, ‘let’s do this, and then we go phase two.’, Kevin, what would you like to say?, REPRESENTATIVE MCCARTHY:  Well, first, I want to thank you for bringing everybody together.  You got the Senate, you got the House, you got both parties.  And I like the exchange of ideas, and I think everybody has a point here., The one thing I don’t want to have happen here is what I saw in the past.  There were four bills that were passed on border security years ago that never got finished.  There were immigration bills passed that — we’re right back at the table with the same problem.  Let’s make a commitment to each one, and, most importantly, to the American people, that, when we get done and come to an agreement, that we’re not back at this problem three, four years from now., That’s why — yes, we’ve got to do DACA, and I agree with you 100 percent — but if we do not do something with the security, if we do not do something with the chain migration, we are fooling each other that we solved the problem.  You know how difficult this issue is.  So let’s collectively — we’re here at the table together.  I’ll be the first one to tell you, we’re all going to have to give a little, and I’ll be the first one willing to., But let’s solve the problem — but let’s not tell the American public at the end that it’s solved when it’s not., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think a good starting point would be Bob Goodlatte, who has done a bill, and I understand you’re ready to submit it.  And you’re going to take that and you’ll submit it and they’ll negotiate it in Congress or the House.  And then it goes to the Senate, and they’ll negotiate — both Republican and Democrat.  But it could be a good way of starting., Now, if anyone has an idea different from that — but, I think, starting in the House.  Starting in the House — Mike, you good?  You’re ready.  I think you’re ready to go., REPRESENTATIVE MCCAUL:  We are, Mr. President., THE PRESIDENT:  I would like to add the words “merit” into any bill that’s submitted because I think we should have merit-based immigration like they have in Canada, like they have in Australia.  So we have people coming in that have a great track record, as opposed to what we’re doing now, to be honest with you., But I think merit-based should be absolutely added to any bill, even if it has to do with DACA.  That would be added to the things I said.  I think it would be popular.  I can tell you, the American public very much wants that., But, Bob, where are you with the bill?, REPRESENTATIVE GOODLATTE:  So, tomorrow, Chairman McCaul and Congresswoman McSally and Congressman Labrador — we’re the chairmen of the two committees and the chairmen of the two subcommittees — are going to introduce a bill that addresses the DACA concerns., And let me thank you, Mr. President, both — I was an immigration lawyer before I was elected to Congress.  I want to thank you both for campaigning on securing our borders and the interior of our country, but also on addressing DACA in a way that makes sense.  Don’t do it ad hoc; do it through the congressional process.  So you’ve challenged us, and we should step up to that challenge.  And we’re going to do it in a bipartisan fashion, but we have to put our best foot forward., And we’re going to do that with this legislation.  It’s going to address DACA in a permanent way, not a temporary short-term thing.  We’re going to address the border enforcement and security and the wall.  We’re going to address — in Mr. McCaul’s bill, we’re going to address interior enforcement, but not everything that the administration had on its list., We’re going to address chain migration.  We’re going to end the visa lottery program.  We’re going to address sanctuary cities and Kate’s Law., We think it is a good bill that will both address the two things our Speaker told us right after you made your decision, which is, we have to address the problem we have with the DACA kids being in limbo, as Dick Dubin described it, and I agree with that.  But we also have to make sure this does not happen again., THE PRESIDENT:  And, Dick, you and the Democrats are going to have a lot of things that they’re not going to agree — you’re going to talk to us about it.  I just felt that this is something that was long overdue.  You’d have a meeting and you’d say, this is what we want.  We’d have a meeting — and this has been going on for years.  And I just — you know, at a certain point, maybe I’ll just lock the doors and I won’t let anybody out — (laughter) — until they come and agree., Michael, do you have something to say about the bill?, REPRESENTATIVE MCCAUL:  Yes, I’ve been in Congress for seven terms.  I’ve been trying to get this border secure for seven terms in Congress.  I think this is a bipartisan issue.  I think DACA is a bipartisan issue., We have an opportunity, I think, before us to get this done for the American people.  When it comes to chain migration and the lottery system, we saw two recent terror attacks in New York that were the result of this, I think, failed immigration policy.  We’d like to see that fixed for the American people and along with, as Bob talked about, sanctuary cities., Now, you and I talked about this extensively.  So we think our bill, our House bill would be a good starting ground for this negotiation.  And I, too, want to commend you for bringing everybody together., I think what we don’t want to see happen is for the conditions for DACA to occur again.  We want to get security done so we don’t have to deal with this problem five more years down the road., So thank you, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are so many points of agreement, and a lot of it is common sense.  And I really think we’re going to come out very well., David Perdue, do you have something to say?, REPRESENTATIVE PERDUE:  Well, yeah, my observation is that three times in the last eleven years, well-intentioned people, some of whom are in this room, attempted to do what we’re starting to try to do today, and we failed.  And I think the difference is, is their mission creep ended up in an effort that became too comprehensive., And so, today, my encouragement for all of us is to do what Dick has been trying to do and talks about repeatedly, and that is to limit the scope of this.  And I like the idea that both sides have pressure to solve the DACA issue.  But I think the bigger issue here is not just the DACA issue, but what we can do to start the path to the steps that solve this immigration problem.  For several reasons — there are social issues; there are political issues; there are economic issues about our workforce that have to be addressed., But limiting this to the legal immigration side and combining the balance between various solutions on DACA; DREAMers, if it gets in the conversation; as well border security and chain migration, I think therein lies the balance of a good deal that can be done., And I don’t think — I agree with Dick.  I don’t think it’s going to take long to get it done if we just lock ourselves in a room and make it happen., THE PRESIDENT:  I think you’re right.  I think it could be done very quickly., Would anybody have anything to say prior to the press leaving?, REPRESENTATIVE MCSALLY:  Mr. President, I just have one comment., THE PRESIDENT:  Yes., REPRESENTATIVE MCSALLY:  Senator Durbin mentioned that lives are hanging in the balance.  As we come up on the January 19th deadline, the lives that are hanging in the balance are those of our military that are needing the equipment and the funding and everything they need in order to keep us safe, and we should not playing politics on this issue to stop our military from getting the funding that they need., I think we have the right people in the room to solve this issue.  The deadline is March 5th.  Let’s roll up our sleeves and work together on this.  But those who need us right now before the January 19 deadline is our military.  And let’s not play politics with that.  Let’s give them what they need to keep us safe., THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.  And I think a lot of people would agree with that.  We need our military — I can’t say more than ever before.  We had wars.  Right, Lindsey?  We had a lot of other areas and times.  But we need our military desperately.  Our military has been very depleted.  We’re rebuilding, and we’re building it up quickly, and we’re negotiating much better deals with your purveyors and with your manufacturers and with your equipment-makers — much better than it was before., I looked at boats that started off at $1.5 billion, and they’re up to $18 billion, and they’re still not finished.  In this case, a particular aircraft carrier.  I think it’s outrageous.  So we’re very much agreeing with you on that one., Would anybody like to say?  Yes, Steny, go ahead., REPRESENTATIVE HOYER:  I want to follow up on that.  There are no Democrats that don’t want to make sure that the military is funded properly.  And over the last four years, we had an agreement between Mr. Ryan and Senator Murray — Speaker Ryan and — that we understand that our military is critically important.  But we also understand that our domestic issues, whether it’s education, whether it’s healthcare, whether it’s environment, whether it’s transportation and infrastructure, they’re important, as well., And both the defense and non-defense sides of the budget are hurt when you have a CR, because they cannot blink and they cannot get contracts if they don’t have any money to do so.  So that, very frankly, I think Ms. McSally is correct.  But what we ought to have done over the last six months — particularly when we did the September and we gave 90 days — is to reach some agreement on what the caps are going to be.  The Murray-Ryan agreements were parity.  We believe that’s very important., So we can get to where we should get and want to get there, but we ought to have an agreement based upon what the last —, THE PRESIDENT:  But, Steny, we do have to take politics out of the military.  We need that military.  All the other things we talk about, we’re not going to be here if we don’t have the right military.  And we need our military, and we need it stronger than ever before, and we’re ready to do it.  But we have to take politics out of the military., One thing that I think we can really get along with on a bipartisan basis — and maybe I’m stronger on this than a lot of the people on the Republican side, but I will tell you, we have great support from the Republicans — is infrastructure.  I think we can do a great infrastructure bill.  I think we’re going to have a lot of support from both sides, and I’d like to get it done as quickly as possible., Yes, John., SENATOR CORNYN:  Mr. President, I, too, want to thank you for getting us together.  You made the point last week when Republicans were meeting with you that, why are we continuing to have these meetings just among ourselves when what we need to do to get to a solution is to meet, as we are today, as you insisted, on bipartisan basis., But part of my job is to count votes in the Senate.  And as you know when you hosted us, the leadership, at Camp David this weekend, I believe both the Speaker and Majority Leader McConnell made crystal clear that they would not proceed with a bill on the floor of the Senate or the House unless it had your support, unless you would sign it., So that’s, I think, the picture we need to be looking through — the lens we need to be looking through is not only what could we agree to among ourselves on a bipartisan basis, but what will you sign into law.  Because we all want to get to a solution here, and we realize the clock is ticking., But I think that for me frames the issue about as well as I can., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Very well said.  One of the reasons I’m here, Chuck, so importantly, is exactly that.  I mean, normally you wouldn’t have a President coming to this meeting.  Normally, frankly, you’d have Democrats, Republicans, and maybe nothing would get done., Our system lends itself to not getting things done, and I hear so much about earmarks — the old earmark system — how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks.  But of course, they had other problems with earmarks.  But maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.  Because this system — (laughter) —, PARTICIPANT:  Yes, yes, yes.  (Laughter.), THE PRESIDENT:  This system — (laughter) — but you should do it, and I’m there with you, because this system really lends itself to not getting along.  It lends itself to hostility and anger, and they hate the Republicans.  And they hate the Democrats.  And in the old days of earmarks, you can say what you want about certain Presidents and others, where they all talk about they went out to dinner at night and they all got along, and they passed bills.  That was an earmark system, and maybe we should think about it., And we have to put better controls because it got a little bit out of hand, but maybe that brings people together.  Because our system right now, the way it’s set up, will never bring people together., Now, I think we’re going to get this done — DACA.  I think we’re going to get — I hope we’re going to get infrastructure done in the same way., But I think you should look at a form of earmarks.  I see Lindsey nodding very hard “yes.”, ...]</td>\n",

According to the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, almost 1,900 aliens from state sponsors of terrorism were selected in the 2005 visa lottery., …, This is not a program in America’s best interests., Chain migration is another feature of our immigration system that does nothing to help America and its legal citizens., …, While a formal amnesty for illegal immigrants has been debated on Capitol Hill, we already have a de facto amnesty program in the form of chain migration. President Trump announced that Saipov, through chain migration, alone brought 23 family members to the United States with him. Chain migration has deemed over three million immigrants eligible, but many must wait because of category limitations. This has served as a driver for illegal immigration, as these applicants choose not to wait for the U.S. immigration bureaucracy to process them., …, A Pulse Opinion Research poll taken over the summer showed a majority of likely midterm voters support ending the visa lottery., …, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) have introduced the RAISE Act, which would, among other objectives, end the visa lottery program and refocus immigration policy in terms of merit, not need.

EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  We actually spent some time together, so I didn’t mind giving you a second “hello.”  Not at all.  We’ve known each other a long time.  We’ve been friends for a long time, from the beginning of the campaign.  And these are special people., Please, sit down., Vice President Pence — thank you very much for joining us, Mike.  I also want to recognize Acting Director Homan, who’s leaving us.  He’s been truly a star.  And he’s leaving.  He’s retiring.  But where is Tom?  Is he around here someplace?  Tom.  Stand up, Tom.  (Applause.)  Tom has been doing what he’s doing for 34 years and doing it with strength and dedication.  And you are really outstanding, and your highly recommended replacement is going to do a great job.  We know him well.  He’s going to do really great.  Thank you, Tom, for those years of service., I also want to thank the incredible ICE Officers, Border Patrol agents, and law enforcement officials who join us here today.  If you could stand up, please.  These people are also special people.  (Applause.)  And they’re good-looking people.  Aren’t they?  Huh?  (Laughter.)  Good-looking people.  Thank you very much for being here and for the bravery.  What you do and what you endure is incredible., I also want to stand and have the brave men and women from all over government agencies — we have a lot — maybe just raise your hand or stand.  But we really appreciate the job that you’ve done, especially during the last year and a half, because I know you’ve really put in a lot of extra.  So, please.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.), We’re gathered today to hear directly from the American victims of illegal immigration.  You know, you hear the other side.  You never hear this side.  You don’t know what’s going on.  These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones — the word “permanently” being the word that you have to think about — “permanently.”  They’re not separated for a day or two days.  These are permanently separated, because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens., These are the families the media ignores.  They don’t talk about them.  Very unfair.  We have to look at everybody.  But this is a very unfair situation.  And I knew that years ago when we would be together out campaigning.  And I said, “If this ever happens, we’re never forgetting you.”  You know that, Laura, everybody.  Incredible people.  And they’re dedicated., These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration, they don’t want to discuss, they don’t want to hear, they don’t want to see, they don’t want to talk about.  No major networks sent cameras to their homes or displayed the images of their incredible loved ones across the nightly news.  They don’t do that.  They don’t talk about the death and destruction caused by people that shouldn’t be here, people that will continuously get into trouble and do bad things., For years, their pain was met with silence; their plight was met with indifference.  But no more.  I told them three years ago when we were together, from day one — just about day one I would say — I said, “I hear you, I see you, and I will never let you down.”  And we’ve been working together, and their loved ones have not died in vain.  We all know that., We call these brave Americans the Angel Families — Angel moms, Angel pops.  These are the Angel Families.  Your loss will not have been in vain.  We will secure our borders.  And we will make sure that they’re properly taken care of eventually.  The word will get out.  We’ve got to have a safe country.  We’re going to have a safe country.  And your loved ones are going to be playing and will continue to play a big part in it.  You know that, right?  You know that., So here are just a few statistics on the human toll of illegal immigration.  According to a 2011 government report, the arrests attached to the criminal alien population included an estimated 25,000 people for homicide, 42,000 for robbery, nearly 70,000 for sex offenses, and nearly 15,000 for kidnapping., In Texas alone, within the last seven years, more than a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 criminal offenses.  You don’t hear that.  I always hear that, “Oh, no, the population is safer than the people that live in the country.”  You’ve heard that, fellas.  Right?  You’ve heard that.  I hear it so much.  And I say, “Is that possible?”  The answer is it’s not true.  You hear it’s like they’re better people than what we have — than our citizens.  It’s not true., In 2016, more than 15,000 Americans died from a heroin overdose.  More than 90 percent of the heroin comes from across the southern border.  Ninety percent., As a result of sanctuary city policies, in Fiscal 2017, more than 8,000 criminal aliens — these are really hardcore criminal aliens — were in police custody and were released because of our weak laws.  Weakest in the world.  Weakest in the history of the world.  They were released back into our civilian population.  And these gentlemen had to do some of the releasing, and I don’t think you were too happy when you knew.  Because you knew — they know better than anybody.  You knew what you were releasing.  You knew it was trouble.  And it often comes back to be trouble., Where is the media outrage over the catch-and-release policies that allow deadly drugs to pour into our country?  Where is the condemnation of the Democrat sanctuary cities that release violent criminals into our communities and then protect them?  Like the Mayor of San Diego, when she warned everybody that ICE is coming, and they scattered.  A big operation.  A very expensive operation.  They were all together.  They all scattered.  And what are they going to do about looking at her, by the way?  I’ve been asking this question now for four weeks.  She can do that?  And where is the outcry over the savage gang MS-13 and its bloodthirsty creed, “Kill, Rape, and Control”?, Because the news media has overlooked their stories, I want the American people to hear directly from these families about the pain they have had to endure, losing not only their loved ones — great people.  Great Americans.  People that would have been very successful.  People that, in some cases, could have been here one day.  Could have been here.  I know the way you feel.  But could have been right here, standing here., First, I’d like to ask a friend of mine, for now a long time, Laura Wilkerson from Pearland, Texas, to come and share her story about her incredible, incredible boy.  Right?, MS. WILKERSON:  Yes., THE PRESIDENT:  Come on, Laura.  Just say a few words., MS. WILKERSON:  We want to tell you a little bit today about Josh.  He was brutally tortured, strangled over and over.  He was set on fire after death.  His last hours were — was brutal.  As everyone standing up here, none of our kids had a minute to say goodbye.  We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for 5 days or 10 days.  We’re separated permanently.  Any time we want to see or be close to our kids, we go to the cemetery, because that’s where they are.  We can never speak to them.  We can’t Skype with them.  And I want to thank you so much, in this room, for what you’re doing to understand — you guys know the permanent separation.  It’s the media that won’t share it with other people.  It’s permanent.  We can never have them back on this Earth.  Thankfully, I’ll see him again in Heaven., But I want to thank you, Mr. Trump, and Vice President Trump for — I mean, Vice President Pence — for keeping their commitment to us.  It’s been ongoing.  It continues on.  And please understand there are so many more of us than what you see here that have the same story.  Over and over — drunk driving, killed.  Over and over.  And they don’t prosecute, or they’re let go on low bond.  They’re out in 30 days.  It’s sad for our country and it’s time to take it back., And I want to thank each and every one of you law enforcement.  You know it.  You love it, you want to do your jobs.  And thankfully, we have a President who will allow you to do that now.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Laura., Next, I’d like to ask Juan Piña from Greenfield, California to speak.  Juan, please come up.  Thank you.  Thank you, Juan., MR. PIÑA:  My name is Juan Piña.  First of all, I want to thank the Remembrance Project for bringing my daughter’s name out to light, and for candidate Trump to let me speak about her.  And I’ve got a lot of people that I need to thank., My daughter was Christy Sue Piña.  Back in 1990, she was kidnapped, strangled, stabbed, raped, and sodomized, and her body was found in an artichoke field.  I’ve been fighting for twenty-eight and a half years.  He’s been fighting.  He was loose for 25.  The last three and a half years he’s been fighting extradition., And on May 3rd, God answered my prayers and Mexico finally turned him loose to us.  And he is now in the Monterey County Jail and we can start court procedures for my daughter’s death., And I want to thank everybody that was involved in getting him over here, the sheriff department of Monterey County for the investigator.  The sheriff never told her, “Don’t give up on this.  Just stay on it, and stay on it.”  And she pinky swore that she was going to get him over there, and she did., And I just want to thank the President and everybody.  And I just hope   everybody can get what I just got.  And I’m out here speaking for the thousands of victims that we have here in the United States.  And I want to thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  So Juan fought for many years, and it’s hard to believe but that’s actually a great feeling., MR. PIÑA:  Yes, it is., THE PRESIDENT:  And you just — incredible job.  Incredible job., Also here with us today is Steve Ronnebeck from Mesa, Arizona.  Steve, if you could come up and share a few words, please., MR. RONNEBECK:  Thank you, Mr. President.  January 22nd, 2015, Grant was at work on his overnight shift.  An illegal alien came in wanting to buy cigarettes, dumped a jar of change out on the counter.  Grant went to count the change and wasn’t counting fast enough.  So, basically, this man pulled a gun.  Grant did everything he was supposed to do and gave him the cigarettes.  The man went ahead and executed him and shot him point blank in the face., You know, you don’t hear these stories, and some of our media won’t talk to you about it, but this is permanent separation.  For his birthday, I go to his grave.  For Christmas — we set up a Christmas tree on Grant’s grave., I received something earlier today from Director Homan; it was a challenge coin.  And I want to thank you for that.  To me this is a sign of integrity.  I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our President, our Vice President, Director Homan, all of you in law enforcement.  I wish some of our media had the same integrity.  And I want to thank all of you, especially our law enforcement, for what you do., Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, thank you.  Members of VOICE, Barbara Gonzalez, Jon Feere, AVIAC — I want to thank all of them too, because they’re helping get the stories out.  Sixty-three thousand Americans since 9/11 have been killed by illegal aliens.  This isn’t a problem that’s going away; it’s getting bigger., Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Sixty-three thousand.  And that number, they say, is very low because things aren’t reported.  Sixty-three thousand.  And you don’t hear about that., Also here with us today is Michelle Root from Modale, Iowa.  Great place.  Michelle, please come up., MS. ROOT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My daughter, Sarah Root, was killed within 24 hours after graduating with a Bachelor’s — 4.0 — in Criminal Investigations.  Out celebrating, stopped at a stoplight, and rear-ended by Edwin Mejia going 70-plus miles an hour.  He was arrested but then he paid a $5,000 bail, and now he has fled., Our separation, like everybody has said, is permanent.  Sarah never gets to go on to be a wife, a mother, a grandmother, an aunt.  My son does not have his only sibling any longer.  My life has been devastated and so has my daughter’s family and friends., I want to thank President Trump and Vice President Pence, Barbara Gonzalez, Jon Feere, and Director Homan for all their support.  They have never given up on us.  AVIAC was a group that we started because we were tired of not having anybody else to go to, to get information.  When Sarah was killed January 31st of 2016, I had nobody, but I was thankful for my politicians in my area.  And, you know, President Trump was one of the first ones to reach out to my family, and he has been there from the beginning.  He never left our side., Now we just need to get my daughter’s killer found.  Again, my separation is permanent.  Sarah is never coming home.  I never get to take a selfie with her again.  I have no more pictures of her.  So, please — thank you guys for everything.  Keep up the great work.  Our police officers, our Border Patrol, please continue to fight.  Thank you.  (Applause.), MS. MENDOZA:  Thank you.  My name is Maryann Mendoza.  And my son, Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, was killed on May 12th, 2014, on his way home from work by a three-time legal-limit drunk, who was also high on meth.  He had drove over 35 miles the wrong way on four different freeways in Phoenix before slamming head-on into my son’s car., As you know, they could fill this stage up every day for the next five months of victims of illegal alien crime, and it would just keep going.  Unfortunately, we are members of a club of our children, our loved ones who’ve been killed by illegal aliens, but there’s hundreds of thousands of victims every year who are affected by illegal alien crime — rape, assault, identity theft., These are things that go unreported, unchecked.  You know, if the public would go to IllegalAlienCrimeReport.com and see the magnitude of crimes being committed against your fellow Americans by illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country, you will be sickened, because the mainstream media does not let you know what’s really happening., And we are here — the members of AVIAC are here to educate the public as to what’s happening.  And if anybody has been a victim of illegal alien crime, contact us because we have close connections with Barbara Gonzalez at ICE and Jon Feere.  We have connections at the Department of Homeland Security that we are trying to get people the help that they need, and sent in the right direction., President Trump, Vice President Pence, you’ve just been there for us, and there are no words to describe what your support and your caring has meant to each and every one of us.  And thank you from the bottom of my heart.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, darling., Come.  Come.  Your story is incredible., MS. DURDEN:  I’m one of your legal immigrants.  I came the right way.  I paid lots of money.  It took me five years to become a citizen, a proud citizen.  And I didn’t drag my son — he named himself “German Chocolate”; he was born in Germany — I didn’t drag him over borders, through deserts.  I didn’t place him in harm’s way., I protected my child from harm, but I couldn’t do that on July 12th, 2012.  He was 30 years old.  I couldn’t protect him because an illegal alien from Guatemala, with two felonies, one deportation, two DUIs — he was protected.  Riverside, California: sanctuary.  The judge, the DA, they knew who he was.  They gave him probation after his second DUI.  Five weeks later, he killed my child., And if that wasn’t enough to deal with, this is my only child.  I have no family.  That’s it., The public needs to know, and they deserve to know, that this could happen to each one of you at any given second.  You hug your child, you send them off, no matter what age they are.  And then you get that ugly phone call that will forever change your life.  And thank God our President and Vice President, VOICE, my family at AVIAC, they rallied behind us — they were the only ones — and gave us a little light., I was going to end my life; I had no purpose.  But President Trump, coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration, stopped me in my track.  And I had no clue at that point that I would ever be at the White House.  And I thank President Trump, Vice President, everybody behind me — I thank you.  I thank everybody out here.  Make sure you get our stories out.  I brought my son.  This is what I have left — his ashes.  I wear his ashes in a locket.  This is how I get to hug my son., So remember, when you go and hug your kids, that there are many of us, thousands of us, who don’t get to do that anymore.  And let’s work together and get this done — all politicians.  I don’t care what side you’re on.  You don’t want your child in a casket or in an urn., So get it together, for God’s sake, for this country, for our citizens., Thank you.  (Applause.), MR. TRANCHANT:  My name is Ray Tranchant.  And I retired from the Navy.  I flew off of aircraft carriers and had a great Navy career.  And then I started my family in the ’90s.  I had two little girls, Tessa and Kelsey, and they had a bigger brother, Dylan.  And I raised them — and their mother and her mom is Hispanic, and so Tessa was Hispanic.  And they lived near the border, as well., Tessa was 16; she was a dreamer, and so was her friend Allie (ph) Kunhardt — 17 years old — 16 years old.  Both beautiful girls.  And they just loved talking about the future.  They went to a Wawa in Virginia Beach to get a pack of gum, and they were stopped at a stoplight, and Alfredo Ramos was driving at 70 miles an hour.  He was three times the legal limit.  He had been arrested before for DUI, in which the judge gave him no time or fines.  He had a fake ID from Florida, bought by the cartels.  He had a fake driver’s license in this car.  And he couldn’t speak English, and he needed an interpreter for the last DUI hearing.  He was also arrested for drunk in public., Bottom line: As he came in through Mesa and he tried to make it, and he was going — he was three times the legal limit.  So the police told me that, at that, it’s like wearing almost blackout glasses while you’re driving., When he hit the girls from behind, it was an explosion.  The neighborhood thought a bomb went off.  The girls were almost instantaneously dead.  They worked on Tessa for a while, and I got to see her in the hospital., Those are the dreamers that the United States should focus on.  I can’t make an opinion about the young people that are here illegally because their parents brought them.  But I can guarantee you the government had nothing to do with that.  And everybody wants to blame, but the parents of those children are to blame., And there was a lot of, “Well, maybe they’ll feel sorry for them because they’re kids.  And maybe if they behave, they’ll just magically beat the system.”  My mom came from Ireland.  It took her 10 years to get her citizenship.  She had a sponsor.  If she got in trouble, not only did she get in trouble, the sponsor was in trouble., I would have been speaking Northern Irish right now if she got out of line.  That’s the way it was with INS in those days.  And mom loved being an American.  I helped her study for her exam., So I’m all about legal immigration.  But the invaders and people who come over our borders and decide to take the law in their own hands, and maybe are supported by a group of people that, for God’s sakes, I don’t know why they would want to do it — it’s evil, it hurts people, and it costs us billions of dollars a year.  And they don’t seem to want to pay for it.  They want us to pay for it, the other taxpayers., I want to thank President Trump, because when those kids died, I was a city employee, so of course I sued the city and the judge, and the adjoining city with the judge there.  And, of course, they’re immune., But it didn’t make me really friendly with the city.  It didn’t make me friendly with ICE, because basically they claimed they weren’t called.  The sheriff’s department said that we called them, and it was a back-and-forth.  So no one took responsibility., So being in that situation, where no one takes responsibility in this government at all means that your standing in a dark forest at night when it’s raining and it’s cold and your lost, everybody you talk to, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, he was drunk and we have a lot of drunks here and blah, blah” — let me tell you, the guy shouldn’t have been there at that time.  He shouldn’t have been there.  And we had many opportunities to get him out., So what’s happening?  Our representative is the President and the Vice President.  They took us in, and we’re going to fight this battle.  And we’re going to win it.  And we’re going to clean it up.  And I’m very proud of that.  I’m very proud to be a part of that.  And I will support you, as law enforcement, and my President and Vice President as much as they need., I want to thank the Remembrance Project for standing there when I had no one else.  And God bless you, and I hope this doesn’t happen to you.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  This is Tom Selleck.  (Laughter.)  Except better looking.  Right?  Better looking., MS. GIBBONEY:  Thank you.  Thank you.  My name is Angel mom Agnes Gibboney.  My family legally emigrated from Hungary.  We escaped during the revolution.  We couldn’t come to the United States as my mother planned because my father was born in Yugoslavia and they wanted us to stay.  And because my mother said no, they didn’t allow us to come to the American embassy.  We went to — we had the choice of South Africa, Austria, or Brazil.  We went to Brazil and lived there 13 years trying to legally immigrate to the United States., When we immigrated to Brazil, we were stateless.  We didn’t belong anywhere because the government took our citizenship because we escaped.  And when we came to United States, we were stateless.  And I’m very honored and proud to say this is my home, my country.  And I will fight for this country until my death., Thank you, law enforcement, Border Patrol, immigration, Barbara, everybody that got me here today.  And thank you for fighting this fight with us.  Because trust me, you don’t want to talk in our shoes., And, President Trump, thank you for always standing behind us.  You are the biggest birthday present I got, and I’m still waiting for that shovel to help build the wall at the border.  I live in California., And I would like to ask, if you don’t want your state to become a sanctuary state — so I would like to ask President Trump, if you would tweet and endorse us to FightSanctuaryState.com to help us so we’re not going to go down.  Because if California continues on this path, the rest of the country will follow., And I am so proud and honored of you, Mr. President.  The integrity and character that you have shown us, pulling the daggers out of your back every day hasn’t been fair.  But I want you to know that I’m very honored to call you my President.  And God bless you and your family always, and Mr. Pence.  And God bless this country.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.), MR. ROSENBERG:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  This is my son, Drew.  He was in law school in San Francisco in 2010 when Roberto Galo tried to make a last-second left-hand turn and hit him.  Instead of stopping, he tried to flee.  So he accelerated, drove over his body.  My son was on a motorcycle.  His helmet came off, wedged under one of his tires.  He backed up, driving over him a second time, and then trying to get away, went forward.  By that time, a guy had gotten out of the car and stood in front of Galo.  And he stopped with his rear tire on my son’s abdomen.  And five people had to lift the car off of him., But I want to talk about somebody else.  And you heard Agnes mention FightSanctuaryState.com.  In April of this year, I filed with the state of California an initiative to overturn the sanctuary state.  There’s just way too many deaths, way too many traffic collisions., I should just add, on an aside, we gave out driver’s licenses in 2015.  And in two years — the first two years of that — traffic fatalities on what was supposed to be safer roads have gone up 19 percent.  Hit-and-runs have gone up 26 percent.  Yet, they’re still telling people the roads are safer because of that., But there’s so many other — and then, somebody who is not here, a woman named Veronica Cabrera Ramirez — to give you an example of what happens with sanctuary — she was a domestic violence victim.  Called the Santa Rosa police.  They arrested the perpetrator.  He had been deported previously.  ICE filed a detainer.  And then, the day that they decided to release him, instead of calling ICE and giving ICE a chance to show up — they were an hour and a half away — they gave them 16 minutes to show up and they released him.  And 16 days later, he murdered Ms. Ramirez., And according to Kevin de León, who was the author of the sanctuary bill, that makes the state safer — if you keep the federal police, the federal law enforcement over here, and you keep the state law enforcement here, that makes the state safer.  That’s absurd.  It’s outrageous.  And something has to be done and I hope that — as Agnes said, if we don’t kill this in California, it will spread.  And I know it already is in some places.  It’s a death sentence for American law-abiding citizens., Anyway, I’d like to thank the President and the Vice President, and everybody else who is here.  Director Homan, thank you so much.  You’ve become an incredible friend.  Jon Feere, Barbara Gonzalez, and, my new friend today, Kirstjen Nielsen.  (Laughs.)  Anyway, thank you all very much, particularly law enforcement.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  And I just said, “Would you like to speak?”  And you said, “No, I cry too…” — she said, “I’ve been crying for too long, for too much.”  So, that’s fine.  Right?, PARTICIPANT:  Yes., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s good.  Well, I just want to thank everybody for being here.  I know these families.  I know many more families that have gone through the same thing.  And I cannot imagine it being any worse, but we pledge to act with strength and with resolve, and in the memory of those who have been lost so needlessly., And it’s because of families like yours, that my administration created the new office of DHS — the Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement — which has been doing, I hear, a fantastic job.  We call it “VOICE” so that your voices can be heard., Today, we have released the first VOICE report.  Within the first months of VOICE, we’ve opened more than 2,800 victims registered to receive information on their perpetrator.  We’re following these people.  We’re following them so it can’t happen again by that individual., VOICE assisted hundreds of families already, connected them to crucial services such as grief counseling, followed up their cases, and helped ensure that the criminal aliens that harmed their families so egregiously were detained, removed, and deported., Our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the United States.  We want safety in our country.  We want border security.  We don’t want people in our country that don’t go through a process.  We want people in our country based on merit.  Not based on a draw, where other countries put their absolute worst in a bin and they start drawing people.  Do you think they’re going to put their good ones?  They don’t put their good ones.  They put their bad ones.  And then, when they commit crimes, we’re so surprised., We will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all.  We want safety in our country.  We want strong borders.  We want people to come in, but we want them to come in the proper way.  So thank you all for being here.  These are incredible families, incredible people.  Your loved ones have not died in vain.  Much of what we’re doing today is because of what you’ve had to endure., And we just thank you all very much for being here.  And God bless you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you, everybody., Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you., END, 3:15 P.M.

       "      <td>[Roosevelt Room, 4:19 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, everyone. Appreciate it. And good afternoon. I would like to provide an update to the American people regarding the crisis on our southern border — and crisis it is., Illegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars each year., America is a welcoming country. And under my leadership, it’s a welcoming country. We lead the world in humanitarian protection and assistance, by far. There’s nobody even close. We have the largest and most expansive immigration programs anywhere on the planet., We’ve issued 40 million green cards since 1970, which means the permanent residency and a path to citizenship for many, many people. But we will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally. We won’t allow it., Mass, uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful, law-abiding immigrants already living here who followed the rules and waited their turn. Some have been waiting for many years. Some have been waiting for a long time. They’ve done everything perfectly. And they’re going to come in. At some point, they’re going to come in. In many cases, very soon. We need them to come in, because we have companies coming into our country; they need workers. But they have to come in on a merit basis, and they will come in on a merit basis., The communities are often left to bear the cost and the influx of people that come in illegally. We can’t allow that., There’s a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies. Every day, above and beyond our existing lawful admission programs, roughly 1,500 to 2,000 people try crossing our borders illegally. We do a very good job considering the laws are so bad. They’re not archaic; they’re incompetent. It’s not that they’re old; they’re just bad. And we can’t get any Democrat votes to change them. It’s only the Republicans that are — in unison, they want to change them. They want to make strong borders, want to get rid of any crime because of the borders, of which there’s a lot., And we’ve done a great job with the laws that we have. We’re moving in tremendous numbers of people to get out the MS-13 gangs and others gangs that illegally come into our country. And we’re getting them out by the thousands., But this is a perilous situation, and it threatens to become even more hazardous as our economy gets better and better. A lot of the cause of this problem is the fact that we right now have the hottest economy anywhere in the world. It’s doing better than any economy in the world. Jobs, unemployment — you look at any number., Right now, we have more workers than any time in the history of our country. We have more people working, which is a tremendous statement. More people working than at any time in the history of our country. And people want to come in, and in some cases, they want to take advantage of that, and that’s okay. And we want them to come in, but they have to come in through merit. They have to come in legally., At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an “invasion.” It’s like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border. You saw that two days ago. These are tough people, in many cases. A lot of young men, strong men. And a lot of men that maybe we don’t want in our country. But again, we’ll find that out through the legal process., But they’ve overrun the Mexican police, and they’ve overrun and hurt badly Mexican soldiers. So this isn’t an innocent group of people. It’s a large number of people that are tough. They’ve injured, they’ve attacked, and the Mexican police and military has actually suffered. And I appreciate what Mexico is trying to do., So let me begin by stating that these illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States, and they should turn back now, because they’re wasting their time. They should apply to come into our country. We want them to come into our country very much. We need people to help us, with all of these companies that are coming in. We’ve never had anything like this. We have car companies coming in. We have Foxconn — so involved with the manufacturing of Apple products — coming in in Wisconsin. We have a lot of companies coming in, but they have to apply, and they have to be wonderful people that are going to love our country and work hard., And we’ve already dispatched, for the border, the United States military. And they will do the job. They are setting up right now, and they’re preparing. We hope nothing happens. But if it does, we are totally prepared. Greatest military anywhere in the world, and it’s going to be, and is now, in great shape. No longer depleted like it was when I took over as the President of the United States., The government of Mexico has generously offered asylum, jobs, education, and medical care for people within the caravan, but many members of the caravan have refused these offers, which demonstrate that these migrants are not legitimate asylum-seekers. They’re not looking for protection. Because if they were, they’d be able to get it from Mexico. Mexico has agreed to take them in and encouraged them to stay. But they don’t want to stay; they want to come into the United States. So this is no longer safety, and asylum is about safety., Asylum is not a program for those living in poverty. There are billions of people in the world living at the poverty level. The United States cannot possibly absorb them all. Asylum is a very special protection intended only for those fleeing government persecution based on race, religion, and other protected status., These caravans and illegal migrants are drawn to our country by Democrat-backed laws and left-wing judicial rulings. We’re getting rulings that are so ridiculous, so bad. They’re writing the laws. Can’t do that. Collectively known as — as an example, catch-and-release. It’s a disgrace that we have to put up with it., These policies lead to the release of illegal aliens into our communities after they’ve been apprehended. But we’re not releasing anymore. Big change, as of a couple of days ago. We’re going to no longer release. We’re going to catch; we’re not going to release. They’re going to stay with us until the deportation hearing or the asylum hearing takes place. So we’re not releasing them into the community., We have millions of people that, over the years, have been released into the community. They never show up for the trials. They never come back. They’re never seen again. And those people, they know who they are. And we know a lot of where they are, who they are. And those people will be deported, directly deported., The biggest loophole drawing illegal aliens to our borders is the use of fraudulent or meritless asylum claims to gain entry into our great country. An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds a Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language — by lawyers and others that stand there trying to get fees or whatever they can get — they’re given a phrase to read. They never heard of the phrase before. They don’t believe in the phrase. But they’re given a little legal statement to read, and they read it. And now, all of a sudden, they’re supposed to qualify. But that’s not the reason they’re here., This merely asserts the need for asylum, and then often released into the United States, and they await a lengthy court process. The court process will takes years sometimes for them to attend. Well, we’re not releasing them into our country any longer. They’ll wait for long periods of time. We’re putting up massive cities of tents. The military is helping us incredibly well., I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They’ve been so efficient, so good, so talented. And we have thousands of tents. We have a lot of tents; we have a lot of everything. We’re going to hold them right there. We’re not letting them into our country. And then they never show up — almost. It’s like a level of 3 percent. They never show up for the trial. So by the time their trial comes, they’re gone. Nobody knows where they are. But we know where a lot of them are, and they’re going to be deported., There are now nearly 700,000 aliens inside the United States awaiting adjudication of their claims. Most of these people we have no idea how they got there, why they got there. And the number is actually going to be a much larger number as we look at all of the data. So if you look at just at a minimal number, it’s the size of Vermont, or bigger. And the overall number could be 10 million people; it could be 12 million people; it could be 20 million people. The record keeping from past administrations has not exactly been very good., As human smugglers and traffickers have learned how the game is played and how to game the system, we have witnessed a staggering 1,700 [percent] increase in asylum claims since the year 2010. They understand the law better than the lawyers understand the law. You have a lot of professionalism there. You have a lot of professionalism involved with setting up the caravans. You take a look at the way that’s happening. Even the countries — you look at Honduras and El Salvador, and you look at what’s happening at the different levels and different countries, and what’s happening on the streets. There’s a lot of professionalism taking place, and there seems to be a lot of money passing. And then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, these big caravans are formed and they start marching up. They got a long way to go., On average, once released, an asylum case takes three and half years to complete. Think of it. Somebody walks into our country, reads a statement given by a lawyer, and we have a three-and-a-half-year court case for one person, whereas other people tell them, “Out. Get out. Just get out.” Other countries — “Get out. We have a border. Get out.”, We go through years and years of litigation because of the Democrats and the incompetent, very, very stupid laws that we have. They’re the laughingstock all over the world, including the people that are marching up. They understand. But the difference is, we’re not allowing them in, and we’re not releasing, and we’re not doing any of the things that were done for so many years that really are terrible for our country., The overwhelming majority of claims are rejected by the courts, but by that time, the alien has usually long since disappeared into our country. So they never get to see the judge. They never get to have a ruling. They don’t care because they’re in the country and nobody knows where they are., All told, there are approximately 1 million aliens who have received final orders of removal. They’ve actually got final orders of removal. You don’t have to go to court anymore. The courts have already issued the orders of removal, and we’ve gotten a lot of them. But who remain at large in our country. So we’ve moving them out., This endemic abuse of the asylum system makes a mockery of our immigration system, displacing legitimate asylum-seekers — and there are legitimate asylum-seekers — while rewarding those who abuse or defraud our system, which is almost everybody. Everybody is abusing it and just doing things to our system which were unthinkable, I’m sure even by the Democrats who were largely responsible for getting it done., These individuals disrespect the foundations of American government by voluntarily choosing to break the law as their first act on American soil., Furthermore, contained within this giant flow of illegal migration to our southwest border is the movement of illicit and deadly narcotics. It’s in the southwest, most of it comes in. Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through the southern border– think of that: 100 percent, almost, of heroin comes in through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, and the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of the ultra-lethal fentanyl killing our youth. Fentanyl is killing our youth., These drugs destroy the lives and kill much more than 70,000 Americans every single year. And the number goes up. It goes up and up and up, because we are so foolish with our laws that we allow this to happen. A death toll equivalent of the size of an entire American city every year., \\nThe current influx, if not halted, threatens to overwhelm our immigration system and our communities, and poses unacceptable dangers to the entire nation. We have to have our borders. Can’t let drugs come in. Not just — it’s not just people. It’s people; it’s drugs. It’s human traffickers., Human trafficking is now at the highest level in the world that it’s ever been. And that’s because of the Internet. Think of it — human trafficking. You think back 200 years, 500 years. Human trafficking — where they steal children; in many cases, women, unfortunately. They steal women. The human traffickers, the lowest scum on Earth. The lowest scum on Earth. And it’s at a level that it’s never been. Worldwide — never been at a level like this., If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow. And you see that’s what’s happening now. We have one that’s coming up, and it’s being somewhat dissipated, as they march. But then other people are joining it. And then it gets bigger. And now, if you look back at Honduras, and if you look at El Salvador, other ones are solving and they’re forming. They’re forming. You have new ones that are forming. And we call it “caravan number two” is unbelievably rough people. Very, very hard for the military to stop it. Our military will have no problem. But very, very hard. Mexico is having a very, very hard time with it., Once they arrive, the Democrat Party’s vision is to offer them free healthcare, free welfare, free education, and even the right to vote. You and the hardworking taxpayers of our country will be asked to pick up the entire tab. And that’s what’s happening — medical and, in many cases, they’ve got some big medical problems before they get here., No nation can allow itself to be overwhelmed by uncontrolled masses of people rushing their border. That’s what’s happening. They are rushing our border. They are coming up. And even before you get to the caravan, just on a daily basis, people coming in. And it’s a very bad thing for our country. It’s sad in many ways, but it’s a very bad thing for our country. And again, costs us billions and billions and billions of dollars a year., And I will therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this crisis. And that’s what we’re doing. The United States military, great people., My administration is finalizing a plan to end the rampant abuse of our asylum system — it’s abused — to halt the dangerous influx, and to establish control over America’s sovereign borders. We got borders. And once that control is set and standardized, and made very strong — including the building of the wall, which we’ve already started. $1.6 billion spent last year; $1.6 billion this year. We have another $1.6 [billion] that will be coming, but we want to build it at one time. All it does is turn people in a different direction if you don’t. We want to build it at one time., Under this plan, the illegal aliens will no longer get a free pass into our country by lodging meritless claims in seeking asylum. Instead, migrants seeking asylum will have to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. So they’re going to have to lawfully present themselves at a port of entry. Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country. We will hold them — for a long time, if necessary., The only long-term solution to the crisis, and the only way to ensure the endurance of our nation as a sovereign country, is for Congress to overcome open borders obstruction. That’s exactly what it is: It’s open border obstruction. No votes. You can come up with the greatest border plan, the greatest immigration plan. You won’t get one vote from a Democrat. They have terrible policy. In many cases, they’re terrible politicians. But the one thing I give them great credit for: They vote as a bloc. They stick together., And we will end catch-and-release. We’re not releasing any longer. We also must finish the job that we started by being strong at the border. When we’re strong at the border, people will turn away and they won’t bother. You will see, in a year from now, or in certainly a period of time from now, despite our very good economy, which some of them come for that — I can’t blame them for that; you have to do it legally — but you will see that the numbers of people trying to get in will be greatly reduced., But that can only happen if we’re strong at the border. And the southern border is a big problem, and it’s a tremendous problem for drugs pouring in and destroying our youth, and, really, destroying the fabric of our country. There’s never been a drug problem like we have today. And as I said, much of it comes from the southern border., So in the meantime, I will fulfill my sacred obligation to protect our country and defend the United States of America. And this is a defense of our country. We have no choice. We have no choice. We will defend our borders, we will defend our country., Thank you very much., Q Mr. President, what happens to the children then? If you’re ending catch-and-release, what happens to those children? Do they stay in these tent cities? Or what happens?, THE PRESIDENT: We’re working on a system where they stay together. But I will say that, by doing that, tremendous numbers — you know, under the Obama plan, you could separate children. They never did anything about that. Nobody talks about that. But under President Obama, they separated children from the parents. We actually put it so that that didn’t happen., But what happens when you do that is you get tremendous numbers of people coming. It’s almost like an incentive to — when they hear they’re not going to be separated, they come many, many times over. But President Obama separated the children, the parents. And nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, this country went crazy., So we are going to continue and try to continue what we’re doing. But it is a tremendous incentive for people to try. But it’s going to be very, very hard for people to come into our country. So we think we’ll be able to do that., Q With the military, do you envision them firing upon any of these people?, THE PRESIDENT: I hope not., Q Could you see the military (inaudible)?, THE PRESIDENT: I hope not. It’s the military — I hope — I hope there won’t be that. But I will tell you this: Anybody throwing stones, rocks — like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico — we will consider that a firearm. Because there’s not much difference, where you get hit in the face with a rock — which, as you know, it was very violent a few days ago — very, very violent — that break-in. It was a break-in of a country. They broke into Mexico., And you look at what’s happening in Guatemala, just to mention Guatemala, along with El Salvador and Honduras. It’s disgraceful that those countries aren’t able to stop this. Because they should be able to stop it before it starts., And the United States pays them a fortune, and we’re looking at not doing that anymore. Because why should we be doing that when they do nothing for us?, Jeff. Jeff, go ahead., Q Mr. President, how is this plan going to be legal, considering the current law?, THE PRESIDENT: Oh, this is totally legal. No. This is legal. We are stopping people at the border. This is an invasion, and nobody is even questioning that., Q But in terms of your plans to change asylum, are you going to do this via executive order?, THE PRESIDENT: No, no, you don’t have to — you don’t have to release. You have — you can hold. The problem is, to hold people, you need massive facilities. It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Another country says, “Sorry, you can’t come in.” With us, we take their name, take their phone number, take their everything, and say, “Good luck.” Only because we don’t have the facilities to hold people. But we’re building the facilities now. We’re building massive numbers of tents, and we will hold them in tents. But you don’t have to release them. They released them only because they didn’t have the facilities to hold them., Q Mr. President, is there like an executive order that you’re going to be releasing today?, THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we will be doing an executive order sometime next week, yes., Q (Inaudible) executive order dealing with ending catch-and-release and asylum?, THE PRESIDENT: It’s going to end — it’s going to be talking about everything. It’ll be quite comprehensive. Many of the things we’ve talked about today., Q Mr. President, so you’re — so just to clarify, you are speaking of, in the tents, these family units that would arrive (inaudible) the children?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have other facilities also. But what’s happened is we are holding so many facilities — so many people that our facilities are being overrun. They’re being overrun. And we are putting up temporary facilities. Eventually, people won’t be coming here anymore when they realize they can’t get through., Q So they will hold the children in those tents with their parents?, THE PRESIDENT: We will be holding the family and the children together. Remember this: President Obama separated children from families. And all I did was take the same law, and then I softened the law. But by softening the law, many people come up that would not have come up if there was separation., Q Mr. President, what do you say to the critics who think this is a political thing before the midterms?, THE PRESIDENT: There’s nothing political about a caravan of thousands of people, and now others forming, pouring up into our country. We have no idea who they are. All we know is they’re pretty tough people when they can blast through the Mexican military and Mexican police. They’re pretty tough people. Even Mexico said, “Wow, these are tough people.” I don’t want them in our country. And women don’t want them in our country. Women want security. Men don’t want them in our country. But the women do not want them. Women want security. You look at what the women are looking for. They want to have security. They don’t want to have these people in our country. And they’re not going to be in our country. It’s a very big thing., Yes., Q Mr. President, when you talk about finalizing a plan to end asylum, is this a plan that would be included in that executive order?, THE PRESIDENT: Oh, no, people are going to have a chance to go for asylum. But if you look at the records, not very many people are allowed to stay once they go to court. But what happens is they’d go into — they were using asylum — first of all, they were told what to say by lawyers and others. “Read this statement.” You read the statement, and now you’re seeking asylum. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we won’t put up with it any longer., Q President Trump, U.S. law and international law says that people who have valid claims have a right to seek asylum., THE PRESIDENT: That’s right., Q So why would — why would they be —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re going to go to court. They’re going to go to court, as crazy as it sounds. They’re going to go —, Q But the law say that they don’t — they’re not —, THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. Excuse me. Ready? They’re going to go to court, and a judge is going to determine. But usually, when they go to court, they’re deported. It just seems that most of the people are deported once they go. The problem is they never end up going to court, because when they come in, they’re told to come back in a year, for a court case, and they disappear into the United States never to be seen again., But we’re going to be —, Q But the current laws doesn’t say about holding people in tent cities., THE PRESIDENT: And they’re given deportation notices. We will be deporting those people., Q Mr. President, you’re saying rocks are — rock-throwing, like happened in Mexico, will be considered —, THE PRESIDENT: We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they’re throwing rocks viciously and violently. You saw that three days ago. Really hurting the military. We’re not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We’re going to consider — and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle., Jeff?, Q A separate topic, sir. Did you offer Heather Nauert the job of U.N. Ambassador?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, she’s under very serious consideration. She’s excellent. She’s been with us a long time. She’s been a supporter for a long time. And she’s really excellent. So she’s under very serious — we’ll probably make a decision next week. We have a lot of people that want the job, and there are a lot of really great people. But we’ll be talking about that next week sometime., Q Did you see Oprah Winfrey’s comments today?, THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t. What did she say?, Q She was campaigning in Georgia at the same time that Vice President Pence was., THE PRESIDENT: At the same time as who?, Q Excuse me, at the same time Vice President Pence was, encouraging people to vote and —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s okay. I mean, I was on Oprah’s last week — the last week of her show. Oprah liked me very much. I’ve always liked Oprah. You know, Oprah is good. But the woman that she’s supporting is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia, by any stretch of the imagination., And I’ll be in Georgia the next few days — the next few days — and we have a tremendous — around Macon — we have a tremendous crowd already. Nobody has a crowd like we have because people want to see a great governor of Georgia. And I think Brian is going to be a great governor of Georgia. I think he’ll be a fantastic governor. He’s totally qualified., She is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia. She’s not qualified. And Georgia is a great state —, Q Why is she not qualified?, THE PRESIDENT: — it’s a great, great state. Take a — take a look. Take a look at her past. Take a look at her history. Take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state. That state will be in big, big trouble very quickly. And the people of Georgia don’t want that., Question?, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement Headquarters, Washington, D.C., 11:58 A.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Secretary Nielsen, Acting Director Vitiello, and to all of the courageous Americans who every day are “protecting national security and upholding public safety,” it is my great honor — at a critical time in the life of this agency — to address the dedicated men and women of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Thank you.  (Applause.), And I bring greetings this morning from a great champion of law and order.  And as he reminded and wanted me to convey today, a leader who stands without apology with the men and women of ICE and law enforcement at every level.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), Just this week, President Trump said that the men and women of ICE are, in his words, “incredible people,” and I know that to be true — “incredible patriots.”  The President sent me here today with a very simple message: While I stand before you today at time when some people are actually calling for the abolition of ICE, in this White House, let me be clear: We are with you 100 percent.  And as the President said last night, “We will always stand proudly with the brave heroes of ICE and our Border Patrol.”  (Applause.)  We will., Now before I go further, let me give thanks to a few other great leaders.  First and foremost, I want to thank Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.  Not just for the warm introduction, but more importantly for her strong and resolute leadership of our Department of Homeland Security.  She has stood strong for the courageous men and women of this agency; and the American people and our safety have been advanced as a result.  Would you join me in thanking the Sixth Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, for your service to the United States.  (Applause.), Let me also take a moment to recognize a new leader of this agency, as of Monday of this week.  But a man who has spent more than 33 years enforcing and upholding our laws, defending our borders, and seeing to the law and order, and the protection of the American people.  Join me in thanking Acting Director Ronald Vitiello for a career of service and for stepping up to serve our nation at such a time as this.  (Applause.), And finally, let me just say thank you to all of you — all of you who are here today and all of you who are watching all across this nation at the more than 400 offices of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.  You’re on the frontlines of enforcing America’s laws and ensuring our — the vitality of this nation and the security of our people.  And you have our thanks; the thanks of our President; and, I want to assure you, you have the thanks and the admiration of the American people., It’s been true ever since this agency was founded more than 15 years ago.  Over the years, I’ve had the privilege to meet countless ICE agents and Border Patrols officers.  I was recently with the Secretary at El Centro Station, Imperial Valley, California, and I never failed to be inspired when I’m around men and women who have answered a call to uphold the laws of this nation throughout this great and storied agency., The truth is, your courage, your determination, your dedication to the law and to the American people inspires me and inspires the people of this country.  At this agency, as the Secretary just described, more than 20,000 patriots stand every day — investigators, field officers, special agents, analysists — each and every day stand for the rule of law in this nation and stand for the interests of the American people.  You step up to enforce our system of legal immigration., And the truth is, every day — every day, men and women of ICE also confront criminal illegal immigrants who endanger our communities and prey on our most vulnerable.  Our ICE agents are busy every day taking them off the streets.  You’ve fought vicious gangs like MS-13.  You’ve stopped human smugglers, child traffickers, and destructive drug cartels that are poisoning our youth and stealing lives of promise.  You’ve apprehended terrorists who’ve come into our country to challenge our way of life and harm our people., The truth is, the statistics really don’t tell the tale, but they’re worth repeating.  In 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made 4,818 gang arrests, including — they took from the streets — 796 members of the MS-13 gangs.  And our communities are safer as a result.  (Applause.), There were nearly 33,000 arrests by ICE personnel — criminal arrests, individuals who came into this country illegally and then pursued crime against our people.  Nearly a million pounds of narcotics were seized by ICE agents in 2017 alone.  And most touchingly to me, as a father, ICE agents rescued 518 human trafficking victims, and 904 children subject to child exploitation were rescued by ICE agents all across America.  We are enforcing our laws and protecting the most vulnerable.  (Applause.), You do all this because you love your country.  You do all this because you’re called to serve.  But I want you to know, President Trump and I and the American people understand that, behind these statistics, in this work you also — you do so oftentimes without regard to your personal safety.  Men and women of ICE, like all of law enforcement, you’ve answered a call that requires you to put the lives of your countrymen ahead of your own.  And I want you and your loved ones to know that we understand this.  We appreciate and understand the risks that you face when you come into contact with violent criminals, when you enforce the law, when you remove drug dealers and gang members from our streets that threaten our families., In recent years, tragically, attacks on you and your fellow law enforcement officers have risen dramatically.  In 2017, attacks on your fellow DHS colleagues at Customs and Border Protection increased by nearly 75 percent.  And at ICE, assaults on your officers nearly tripled in 2017., But remarkably, but not surprisingly, these attacks have not diminished your commitment, or your courage, or your determination to enforce our laws.  I see it in your faces as I’m addressing you today, and I see it every time that I’m with ICE and Border Patrol personnel.  The challenges only steel the resolve of courageous men and women who have the character to serve.  And I want to assure you, these challenges and the challenges you face have only strengthened the resolve of this President and this administration to stand with you every step of the way.  (Applause.), I want to assure you, as I travel across this country, that the American people know that men and women of ICE are American heroes, that you’re doing an important job.  You’re often doing a dangerous job, and you’re doing it for them.  And I want to promise you that we’re going to continue to work to make sure that this agency has both the support, the respect, and the resources that you deserve to do the job that you have been called to do.  The American people support you because they know how important your mission is., But as we all have seen in the press lately, the heroes of ICE are being attacked and demonized for the work that you do in an unprecedented rate in recent weeks.  ICE has been targeted with protests across this country, not only on the job but in public square and social media, and for many of you, even at your homes.  The hashtag, ”#AbolishICE,” has now taken its place on the Internet.  Protestors chant, “No ban, no wall, no borders at all” at protests around the country.  ICE officers and leadership have had their personal information exposed on social media, and threats to their families have followed this.  Now let me be very clear on this point: The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protest, but these threats against ICE officers and their families must stop and they must stop now.  (Applause.), The sad fact is, though, it isn’t just the expression of the radical left that’s been speaking out against ICE lately.  The truth is that opposition of ICE has moved to the center of the Democratic Party itself., Just when you thought the Democrats couldn’t move farther to the left, leading members of the Democratic Party, including candidates for higher office, are actually openly advocating for the abolition of ICE, an agency that protects the American people and our communities every single day., Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and the Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio have all already called for ICE’s abolition.  A leading candidate for governor of New York actually even appallingly called this agency a “terrorist organization.”  Now let me be clear on this point: The American people have a right to their opinions, but these spurious attacks on ICE by our political leaders must stop.  (Applause.), The type of language that’s being used to describe the men and women of this agency and the work that you do every day is unacceptable.  But you know, it’s not just me saying it.  Despite these calls from top Democrats, even today, the liberal editorial page of the Washington Post had a lead editorial entitled; ICE is “the Wrong Target for Outrage.”  In their editorial, and I quote, the Washington Post acknowledged that the “20,000 employees,” of ICE, “manage more than deportations,” they wrote.  “Its investigative division handles cybercrime; human trafficking; narcotics; counter-proliferation involving nuclear materials [and] other military wares; child exploitation…”  They went on to say, and I quote, in the Washington Post, “Those are all vital and legitimate functions of government, as is deportation. They aren’t going to be abolished, nor should they be.”  (Applause.), You know, the truth is that calls to abolish ICE are not just outrageous.  They’re irresponsible.  Abolishing ICE would mean more illegal immigration, people being able to come into our country.  Last year, ICE actually removed 226,000 illegal immigrants from our communities and our country.  Abolishing ICE would mean more violent crime.  Last year, ICE arrested more than 127,000 immigrants with criminal convictions who are facing charges for breaking our nation’s laws, including criminals who were responsible for 50,000 assault offenses and more than 11,000 weapons offenses, 2,000 kidnapping offenses, and 1,800 homicide offenses., Abolishing ICE would mean more vicious gangs like MS-13.  Now, I’ve already discussed with you the extraordinary progress in the last year that we’ve made removing dangerous MS-13 gang members from our streets.  The truth is that the arrests that were made by ICE represented an 83 percent increase from the last full year over of a previous administration.  That is real progress that’s making a difference for the safety and security of our families and our communities., Abolishing ICE also would mean more drugs in our schools and on our streets.  Last year, ICE has seized nearly 500 tons of narcotics, nearly a million pounds of heroin, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs that criminals and cartels were smuggling into our country.  Abolishing ICE also would mean more human trafficking.  And as I mentioned, last year, 518 human trafficking victims, nearly 1,000 victims of child exploitation., Abolishing ICE also would give terrorists a new chance to exploit immigration loopholes.  That’s exactly what happened before September 11, 2001.  And because of the tireless work of ICE and the entire law enforcement community over the past 15 years, I truly do believe the men and women of this agency over the last 15 years have played a critical role in ensuring that no major terrorist attack occurred on our shores.  And you deserve to be credited.  (Applause.), The record speaks for itself.  And it’s a record of accomplishment and security.  Every day, ICE makes America safer and more secure.  And every citizen of this nation is better off and safer because of the work that you do.  And so today, I want to make it clear to all of you and all of those looking on: Under President Donald Trump, we will never abolish ICE.  (Applause.)  And as the President said, we will never fail to applaud, and expand, and empower this agency with the resources that you deserve., As the President said recently, “We’re not abandoning ICE.”  In fact, it’s just the opposite.  Working with our Republican majorities in the Congress, I’m proud to report President Trump has already given this agency new funding to achieve your mission.  This year we increased your baseline budget to $7 billion; a 10-percent increase over 2017.  And the President’s called on the Congress to give additional resources of more than a billion dollars for 2019, including the hiring of 10,000 new ICE officers and investigators.  Our word to all the courageous men and women is: Help is on the way.  We’re going to make sure you have the resources and the support that you deserve.  (Applause.), And just as important, in this White House, as you all know, we’re fighting to secure our borders so that illegal immigrants, gang members, and dangerous criminals can’t enter our country in the first place., The President has already signed into law the largest investment in border security in nearly a decade, and we’ve started to build the first 100 miles of the new border wall., We’ll continue to call on the Congress — call on the Congress to come together around immigration reforms that secure our border, build a wall, close the loopholes that too often serve as a magnet for vulnerable families or worse to come in across our border., Just be confident of this, President Donald Trump and I will always fight for you.  We’ll always stand with you because we know that you are in the fight every day for the safety and security of the American people.  We’ll always have your back, but I’m here, as your Vice President, to assure you that the American people are with you., As I travel across this country, I hear the admiration and appreciation that millions of Americans have for the men and women of this agency, for the sacrifices that you and your families make every day so that their families can be safe and secure., We’re all grateful for your courage.  We’re grateful for the risk that that you’re willing to take to uphold our laws and defend our country.  We’re frankly grateful that our nation has men and women of such character and selflessness who are willing to step forward in this cause., So men and women of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, I’m here to tell you that we stand with you and we always will.  But not only will we stand with you, giving you the resources and the respect that you deserve, but I also want to assure you that you’re in our prayers.  And I know you’re in the prayers of tens of millions of Americans who understand the risk that you take — who understand that, for many of you, when you walk out the door in the morning, it’s different — like it is for every law enforcement officer in this country., You’ve responded to no ordinary calling.  It’s a calling where you’ve decided to consider others as more important than yourself.  And your families have supported you in this calling.  And we understand that., And so you go with our support, but you do — you go with our prayers.  And for my part, I can’t help but reflect on the words of the Psalmist in my hope that you would be confident that “His faithfulness will be your shield and your rampart.”  That “you will not fear the terror of night or the arrow that flies by day,” that — as you make Him your refuge.  “No harm will overtake you,” ever.  That will be our prayer., So thank you for the honor of addressing you today.  More importantly, thank you for your service.  Thank you for what you do for the American people every day to ensure the success of this nation and the security of our people., I leave here today with renewed confidence that you’ll continue to do just that.  That despite the criticism that may be leveled by some, that I know you’ll continue to do your job with determination.  You’ll uphold the rule of law.  You’ll see to the interests of the American people., And with your continued service and courage, with the support of the American people, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I know we will make America safe again.  And we’ll have all of you to thank., Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  God bless you.  God bless U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement.  And God bless the United States.  (Applause.), END, 12:21 P.M.

       "      <td>[Rose Garden, \\n2:35 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Please.  Thank you.  Thank you very much., We’re here on this very beautiful spring day in the Rose Garden to unveil our plan to create a fair, modern, and lawful system of immigration for the United States.  And it’s about time.  (Applause.), If adopted, our plan will transform America’s immigration system into the pride of our nation and the envy of the modern world.  Our proposal builds upon our nation’s rich history of immigration, while strengthening the bonds of citizenship that bind us together as a national family., Throughout our history, we have proudly welcomed newcomers to our shores.  Out of many people, from many places, we have forged one people and one nation under God, and we’re very proud of it.  (Applause.)  We share the same home, we share the same destiny, and we pledge allegiance to the same, great American flag.  (Applause.), Our policies have turbo-charged our economy.  Now, we must implement an immigration system that will allow our citizens to prosper for generations to come., Today, we are presenting a clear contrast: Democrats are proposing open borders, lower wages, and, frankly, lawless chaos.  We are proposing an immigration plan that puts the jobs, wages, and safety of American workers first.  (Applause.), Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker.  It’s just common sense.  It will help all of our people, including millions of devoted immigrants, to achieve the American Dream., We are grateful to be joined this afternoon by a tremendous number of people from the House, the Senate, and my Cabinet.  And I love you all, but I won’t introduce you all because I’ll be here all day long.  (Laughter.)  But you’re all here., Our plan achieves two critical goals.  First, it stops illegal immigration and fully secures the border.  And, second, it establishes a new legal immigration system that protects American wages, promotes American values, and attracts the best and brightest from all around the world., The proposal begins with the most complete and effective border security package ever assembled by our country — or any other country, for that matter.  (Applause.)  It’s so important., This plan was not developed, I’m sorry to say, by politicians.  We have a lot of politicians.  But you respect the people and you know the people that have developed this plan.  It was designed with significant input from our great law enforcement professionals to detail what they need to make our border — which is 100 percent operationally secure.  One hundred percent., Everyone agrees that the physical infrastructure on the border and the ports of entry is gravely underfunded and woefully inadequate.  We scan only a small fraction of the vehicles, goods, and all of the other things coming across, including people.  And, sadly, the drugs pour across our border.  We’re going to stop it., Investment in technology will ensure we can scan 100 percent of everything coming through, curbing the flow of drugs and contraband, while speeding up legal trade and commerce.  It’s the most heavily traded — monetarily — border anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close., To make certain that we are constantly making the upgrades we need, our proposal creates a permanent and self-sustaining border security trust fund.  This will be financed by the fees and revenues generated at the border crossings itself., Importantly, we’re already building the wall, and we should have close to 400 miles built by the end of next year, and probably even more than that.  It’s going up very rapidly.  (Applause.), And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.  They’re doing a fantastic job on the wall.  And that’s a wall that is desperately needed., As we close the gaps in our physical framework, we must also close the gaps in our legal framework.  Critical to ending the border crisis is removing all incentives for smuggling women and children.  Current law — (applause).  That’s right.  That’s right.  Women and children.  People have no idea how bad it is unless you’re there, and unless you are a member of law enforcement.  They see it every day, and they can’t believe what they see., Current law and federal court rulings encourage criminal organizations to smuggle children across the border.  The tragic result is that 65 percent of all border-crossers this year were either minors or adults traveling with minors.  Our plan will change the law to stop the flood of child smuggling and to humanely reunite unaccompanied children with their families back home — and rapidly.  As soon as possible.  (Applause.), We must also restore the integrity of our broken asylum system.  Our nation has a proud history of affording protection to those fleeing government persecutions.  Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being displaced by those lodging frivolous claims — these are frivolous claims — to gain admission into our country., Asylum abuse also strains our public school systems, our hospitals, and local shelters, using funds that we should, and that have to, go to elderly veterans, at-risk youth, Americans in poverty, and those in genuine need of protection.  We’re using the funds that should be going to them.  And that shouldn’t happen.  And it’s not going to happen in a very short period of time.  Have to get this approved., My plan expedites relief for legitimate asylum seekers by screening out the meritless claims.  If you have a proper claim, you will quickly be admitted; if you don’t, you will promptly be returned home., Crucially — (applause) — our plan closes loopholes in federal law to make clear that gang members and criminals are inadmissible.  These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world — MS-13 and others.  Inadmissible.  Not coming in.  We’re taking them out all the time by the thousands, a year, but they come in.  They are no longer admissible.  And for criminals already here, we will ensure their swift deportation.  (Applause.), We will keep our communities safe.  Americans can have complete and total confidence that under this plan, the borders will finally be fully and totally secured.  (Applause.), And I know a number of our Republican friends and others — Lindsey, I see you sitting right there, and Steve, you’re working on a plan — an immediate plan.  A smaller plan, but a very immediate plan to stop it as of this afternoon.  So, as fast as you can get something done.  This is the big, beautiful, bold plan, but we need something very quickly.  And if you can get it done, that would be fantastic.  Okay?  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Appreciate you working on it., A topic of less discussion in national media, but of vital importance to our country, is our legal immigration system itself.  Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process.  It is totally dysfunctional.  The system will finally be fair, transparent, and promote equality and opportunity for all., Every year, we admit 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents.  These green card holders get lifetime authorization to live and work here and a five-year path to American citizenship.  This is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world, by far., Currently, 66 percent of legal immigrants come here on the basis of random chance.  They’re admitted solely because they have a relative in the United States.  And it doesn’t really matter who that relative is.  Another 21 percent of immigrants are issued either by random lottery, or because they are fortunate enough to be selected for humanitarian relief., Random selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute.  While countless — and you wouldn’t believe how many countries, like Canada, create a clear path for top talent.  America does not., Under the senseless rules of the current system, we’re not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world — anybody.  We’re not able to take care of it.  We’re not able to make those incredible breakthroughs.  If somebody graduates top of their class from the best college, sorry, go back to your country.  We want to keep them here., Companies are moving offices to other countries because our immigration rules prevent them from retaining highly skilled and even, if I might, totally brilliant people.  We discriminate against genius.  We discriminate against brilliance.  We won’t anymore, once we get this passed.  And we hope to get it passed as soon as possible.  (Applause.), Some of the most skilled students at our world-class universities are going back home because they have no relatives to sponsor them here in the United States.  And that’s the only way.  We want these exceptional students and workers to stay, and flourish, and thrive in America.  (Applause.)  Thank you., As a result of our broken rules, the annual green card flow is mostly low-wage and low-skilled.  Newcomers compete for jobs against the most vulnerable Americans and put pressure on our social safety net and generous welfare programs., Only 12 percent of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit.  In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand — and others — that number is closer to 60 and even 70 and 75 percent, in some cases., The biggest change we make is to increase the proportion of highly skilled immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, and we’d like to even see if we can go higher.  (Applause.)  This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive., At the same time, we prioritize the immediate family of new Americans — spouses and children.  The loved ones you choose to build a life with, we prioritize.  And we have to do that.  They go right to the front of the line.  Right to the front of the line, where they should be.  (Applause.), America’s last major overhaul of our legal admissions policy was 54 years ago.  Think of that.  So a major update — and that’s what this is: merit system and a heart system — is long overdue., The millions of legal immigrants who have come to America over the past half century are now cherished members of our national family.  Going forward — (applause) — it is their interest, and in their interest, and their children’s interest, to adopt a green card system that promotes a rising standard of living for all of our citizens., Three in four new jobs at the end of last year went to Americans previously out of the workforce.  Our economy is better probably than it ever has been in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  And because of that great economy, we’re able to do things that nobody ever thought possible before, and that’s what we’re going to do for immigration, finally., Wages are rising but our current immigration system works at cross-purposes, placing downward pressure on wages for the working class, which is what we don’t want to do., Last year, we also passed historic criminal justice reform.  (Applause.)  And we had tremendous backing — bipartisan — from Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals.  I guess we could also use the word “progressives.”  A new word that’s come about., Americans with criminal records are getting a second chance at life in higher numbers than ever before.  Unfortunately, the current immigration rules allow foreign workers to substitute for Americans seeking entry-level jobs.  So, foreign workers are coming in and they’re taking the jobs that would normally go to American workers., America’s immigration system should bring in people who will expand opportunity for striving, low-income Americans, not to compete with those low-income Americans.  (Applause.), Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today, while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow.  And we want immigrants coming in.  We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country, but a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill.  (Applause.), The White House plan makes no change to the number of green cards allocated each year.  But instead of admitting people through random chance, we will establish simple, universal criteria for admission to the United States.  No matter where in the world you’re born, no matter who your relatives are, if you want to become an American citizen, it will be clear exactly what standard we ask you to achieve.  It will be made crystal clear.  (Applause.), This will increase the diversity of immigration flows into our country.  We will replace the existing green card categories with a new visa, the Build America visa — which is what we all want to hear.  (Applause.), Like Canada and so many other modern countries, we create an easy-to-navigate points-based selection system.  You will get more points for being a younger worker, meaning you will contribute more to our social safety net.  You will get more points for having a valuable skill, an offer of employment, an advanced education, or a plan to create jobs., We lose people that want to start companies, and, in many cases, they’re forced to leave our country; go back, usually, to the country where they came from; and they’ll start up companies, and some of those companies are among the biggest and most successful companies today in the world.  They could’ve started them right here in the United States, where they wanted to do it in the first place.  Now they’ll have a chance.  (Applause.), Priority will also be given to higher-wage workers, ensuring we never undercut American labor.  To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient., Finally, to promote integration, assimilation, and national unity, future immigrants will be required to learn English and to pass a civics exam prior to admission.  (Applause.), Through these steps, we will deliver an immigration system that respects, and even strengthens, our culture, our traditions, and our values., Four months ago, I had the honor of participating in a swearing-in ceremony for new Americans, right here in the Oval Office.  It was a beautiful reminder that American citizenship is the most precious gift our nation has to offer.  When we swear in new citizens, we do more than give them a permit; we give them a history, a heritage, a home, and a future of limitless possibilities and potential., Our nation used to pride ourselves on this capacity: our unique ability to instill the spirit of America into any human heart, into any human being.  Many of the Democrats have claimed to be for these concepts at different times in their careers and, in many cases, in very recent history.  And I hope that they will end up joining me and all of the people gathered together today in putting politics aside, putting security and wages first, and pursuing these historic reforms.  It’s time.  (Applause.), And if for some reason — possibly political — we can’t get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much., But wouldn’t it be nice to do it sooner than that?  (Laughter.)  But it’s not a very long time, is it?  Sixteen months., One of the reasons we will win is because of our strong, fair, and pro-America immigration policy.  It’s time to restore our national unity and reaffirm our national purpose.  It is time to rebuild our country for all Americans., Together, we will create an immigration system to make America safer, and stronger, and greater than ever before., Thank you.  God bless you all.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you., END, 2:59 P.M.

       "      <td>[Cabinet Room, 11:44 A.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  I’ll be leaving for Minnesota today.  We have two stops; one a very big one, and it will be a lot of fun.  I know a lot of you are going with us, so that will be interesting., We’re meeting right now on immigration.  And we are very strong at the border, we’re very strong on security.  We want security for our country.  The Republicans want security and insist on security for our country, and we will have that.  At the same time, we have compassion.  We want to keep families together; it’s very important.  I’ll be signing something in a little while that’s going to do that.  And the people in this room want to do that, and they’re working on various pieces of legislation to get it done.  But I’ll be doing something that’s somewhat preemptive but ultimately will be matched by legislation, I’m sure., We’re having a lot of problems with Democrats.  They don’t want to vote for anything.  They don’t care about lack of security.  They really would like to have open borders, where anybody in the world can just flow in, including from the Middle East.  From — anybody, anywhere, they can just flow into our country.  Tremendous problems with that.  Tremendous crime caused by that.  We’re just not going to do it., I do want to say that because we’re all so busy, and I just mentioned to the congressmen and the senators in the room, that we are going to cancel and postpone tomorrow’s Congressional Picnic.  We have a Congressional Picnic tomorrow.  And I was just walking over to the Oval Office and I said, you know, it doesn’t feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we’re working on — doing something very important.  We have many things that are important.  We’re talking about trade.  We’re talking about many, many things.  But it didn’t feel exactly right to me., So we will be officially postponing the Congressional Picnic for tomorrow.  We’ll make it another time when things are going extremely well.  And they are going, for the country, extremely well., We have record-setting numbers in every way economically, but we want to solve this immigration problem, which is going on for 40 years, more.  It’s been going on forever.  And we want to see if we can solve it.  So we are cancelling or postponing the Congressional Picnic tomorrow., Would anybody in the room have any question or a statement that you’d like to make while the press is here?  Anybody?  Anybody?, SENATOR SULLIVAN:  I’ll say one, Mr. President.  On the issue of immigration, trade, and investment, these are all areas where Congress has a lot of authority under the Constitution, and you have authority; the executive branch has authority under the Constitution.  And I think that’s why meetings like this are really important, bringing the leadership on both sides together because of important issues., So appreciate the opportunity to let you see our views, hear our views on these issues, where we share authority on important matters.  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  And we all very much have the same views.  We want to keep family together; at the same time, we have to be strong on the border.  Otherwise, you’ll have millions of people coming up — not thousands, like we have now; you’ll have millions of people flowing up and just overtaking the country.  And we’re not letting that happen., So we have to be very strong on the border, but, at the same time, we want to be very compassionate., Yes.  Lamar., REPRESENTATIVE SMITH:  Mr. President, thanks for having us.  I think what Dan said was good.  We really have — on the issues, on trade, on immigration — we have a partnership under the Constitution.  We have some authority; the President has some authority.  We need to work together., I was thinking this morning, when we look at President Nixon’s portrait in the White House, we think that he did the unexpected and he went to China, because he could do that; he was in a position to do it.  And President Reagan did the unexpected.  He went to the Berlin Wall and Moscow., And when we were here a year ago, I think I suggested to you that immigration, which has bedeviled us for 40 years, as you’ve said — I believe you can — you’re the President who can help us solve the immigration problem with your leadership.  You may be able to do for immigration what Nixon did for China and Reagan did for the Soviet Union.  And a lot of us would like to work with you on that., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Lamar, very much., We need the Democrats’ support, because we need their votes.  It’s very simple.  You know, people say we have a majority.  Well, we have a one majority in the Senate.  We need 60.  Unfortunately, we don’t go with the majority; we go with 60.  Someday, somebody will explain why, but that’s the way it is.  We have — we need 60 votes; we have 51 votes at the most.  So we need Democrat votes in order to do it, otherwise you can’t do it., Tom, you were going to say something?  Tom Cotton., SENATOR COTTON:  I think it’s very important that we protect our border.  We cannot allow a child to be a “get out of jail free” card and a “get into the U.S. free” ticket., But at the same time, as you’ve said, as we’ve all said, we’d like to keep families together, keep them together at the border for the orderly and timely processing of the adults immigration claim.  If it’s a lawful, legitimate claim, we can admit the family into the country.  If not, they’ll have to go back to their home country., I’m glad you’re looking for a solution for that.  I know that we, in Congress, are working on legislation that will allow our hardworking Border Patrol agents to keep families together at the border while we process their claims in a timely fashion., THE PRESIDENT:  You’re right.  And you bring up something that I have to say.  Our Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents have done one great job.  ICE is throwing — we’re throwing, by the thousands, MS-13.  They come into the country.  We’re liberating towns on Long Island and other places.  We’re throwing them out by the thousands.  But we need laws that don’t allow them to come back in., Mac, you’ve been very involved in this issue.  Do you have anything to say?, REPRESENTATIVE THORNBERRY:  Well, Mr. President, there are a number of issues that we’re going to be able to discuss today that touch on our country’s national security.  And certainly, controlling who and what comes across our border is an element of national security, as we do the compassionate thing with families., And I look forward to working with you to further strengthen our military.  Together, we have turned around a declining situation.  But that’s also part of what we need to do together.  In fact, to Lamar’s point about we both have responsibilities, we can do more together., THE PRESIDENT:  I will say, with all of the numbers that you see, if we weren’t strong on the border, you’d have hundreds of thousands of people pouring through the border.  They’d just be pouring through, and the country would not be the country anymore., Lindsey?, SENATOR GRAHAM:  We’ve got a big massive mess that’s been going on for decades, and we’re all going to fix it one day, I hope.  But we got a specific problem that puts the country in a dilemma.  Here’s your dilemma and was President Obama’s dilemma, and our dilemma: If a family shows up at the border and we let the family go into the country, and say please come back for your hearing, about 80 percent of the time the adults never show up for the hearing.  I think most Americans feel like that is bad; it will create a third wave of illegal immigration., I want to be fair to people who came here under the old system, but I don’t want to create incentives to create a third wave., The other choice is, is if you detain the parents who broke the law, under the Flores decision you have to break the family up.  So there’s a 1997 Supreme Court case that we’ve got to deal with., So I would urge my Democratic friends to see if we can find a way to keep families together, have a legislative fix of the Flores decision, and argue about the other things later., Because right now, Mr. President, you’re in a real bind.  If you detain the adults, the law requires the children to be separated.  If you let the adults into the country, they’d never show up.  It seems to me that we want to keep the family together and have the parents show up for their day in court., To Senator Schumer: I know there’s a lot we don’t agree on, but surely to goodness we can fix this court decision, because the country is in a bad spot, not just you., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Lindsey, the dilemma is that if you’re weak — if you’re weak, which people would like you to be — if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country is going to be overrun with millions of people.  And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart.  That’s a tough dilemma.  Perhaps I’d rather be strong, but that’s a tough dilemma., SENATOR JOHNSON:  Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead, Ron., SENATOR JOHNSON:  In our community, homeland security, we’ve held 30 hearings on border security.  And you know how much I like data.  And, you know, Senator Graham mentioned the fact that we have these incentives.  There’s nothing compassionate, by the way, of enticing people to take a very dangerous journey on a train they call “the beast,” or through the desert.  We’ve seen the pictures of dead — desiccated bodies in the desert.  There’s nothing compassionate about that., But here’s what’s happened since 2012, since DACA.  Just to talk about unaccompanied children: Prior to that, somewhere between 3,000 or 4,000 unaccompanied children from Central America came into this country.  Then DACA was instituted in 2012, and that problem skyrocketed.  The numbers on it — about 225,000 unaccompanied children, just from Central America; about almost half a million family members.  So we’ve got another 750,000 individuals — very sympathetic — that we’re just incentivizing for coming.  And we have to stop those incentives., Our goal of our policy should be to reduce the flow of people incentivized to come to this country, and that’s what strong enforcement actually does., THE PRESIDENT:  So just so everybody knows, this deal was just about done.  We had a deal signed.  President Obama signed DACA.  When he signed it, he said, I’m really not allowed to sign this, and I’m going to sign it anyway.  But he actually said, I’m not allowed to sign this, never going to hold up.  And they got a judge who held it up, and they got another one who held it up.  Then we had a couple that turned it down, and it’s going to be a Supreme Court issue., But before it was held up, everyone assumed that the DACA would not be held up.  But we had a deal with the Democrats.  It was a deal that everybody agreed to.  It was $25 billion.  We were going to build a wall.  We would take care of many, many different things, including loopholes.  And it was all done, except when this judge ruled in favor of DACA, meaning that it could continue until we get to the Supreme Court, all of a sudden, they weren’t there anymore.  And that’s what happened, and that’s why we’re in this mess — because we had a couple of court decisions, which is going to force an issue to the Supreme Court that shouldn’t be forced to the Supreme Court., Yes, John., SENATOR HOEVEN:  Thanks for inviting up on these important issues, and for having this important discussion certainly on immigration, but also on trade.  And the context that I want to make sure we talk about is, we’ve made incredible progress on tax relief, we’ve made tremendous progress on regulatory relief, and it’s reflected in our economy.  Now, if we can do the same thing on trade, think what that means for our country in terms of economic growth, in terms of jobs, in terms of getting wages moving higher, and the impact that has for all Americans., So we have to look at in that context.  When we talk about trade, it’s on top of tax relief, regulatory relief.  And now, if we can get the right policies in place on trade, think what that means for our country., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re doing very well on trade, I will say.  We’ve been really hurt as a country on trade, for many years.  Despite bad trade deals, we’re doing very well.  And now we’re making very good trade deals.  Well, you’ll be seeing that.  They’ll be announced pretty rapidly.  We already have a couple that are made.  But we’re making great trade deals., And honestly, we need people coming into our country.  You know, we have a lot of companies coming into our country: Chrysler just announced.  We have Foxconn is going up to Wisconsin, as you know, and a great company.  They make the Apple iPhones and laptops and — unbelievable company.  We need people.  We need people that work for these companies because they’re coming in at a number that nobody ever thought possible., So we want people to come into our country, but I think I can speak for everybody at the table: We want them to come in based on merit.  We want great people that will be great for our country.  And we want them to come in based on merit.  We’re going to need those people because we have so many companies coming to the country., John, you were going to say something?, SENATOR CORNYN:  Mr. President, to your point, America is the most generous country in the world when it comes to legal immigration.  And I think we ought to draw a very clear line between legal immigration that benefits our country —, THE PRESIDENT:  Right, absolutely., SENATOR CORNYN:  — and illegal immigration, which is a threat to public safety., I just wanted to make the one point.  I agree with what Tom Cotton and others have said, what you’ve said, about being able to enforce the law and keep families together.  It’s not a mutually exclusive choice.  We can do both.  And I’m confident we will achieve that goal., But I just want to point out that, coming from a border state, like Mac and I do, the border — the illegality along the border is a complex problem because it is — as somebody pointed out, it’s “commodity agnostic.”  In other words, they said it’s people, it’s drugs, it’s weapons.  And you talk about an opioid crisis in the United States — it’s not just prescription drugs; it’s heroin that comes from Mexico., THE PRESIDENT:  Right., SENATOR CORNYN:  So this is a very complex situation.  We need law and order along the border.  Everybody agrees with that.  We need to be compassionate in the way we handle these families.  But it’s important to remember that larger context, because the cartels and the criminal organizations that benefit from this, they’re just making a lot of money and keeping this situation very dangerous for everybody involved., THE PRESIDENT:  And, John, in many ways, they’re using the children and always — they’re using the children as a ticket to getting into the country., SENATOR CORNYN:  Absolutely., THE PRESIDENT:  And we have to remember that.  You know, there’s a number of the 12,000 children; 2,000 are with the parents, and 10,000 came up with some really horrible people, in some cases.  You have the coyotes, you have the traffickers — the human traffickers — not only drug traffickers, but you have the human traffickers.  And they use these children as passports to get into the country.  So we have to work on that, too.  It’s a very complex issue., It has been going on — you shouldn’t feel guilty, because it’s been going on for many, many years.  Many, many decades.  But we’re going to solve that, along with a lot of other problems that we’ve already solved.  We’re doing well at solving problems., You know, when I became President, we had North Korea; we had the Iran deal, which was no good; we had lots of problems with trade and bad trade deals.  There are a lot of things that we’ve solved and we’re solving that, in theory, I shouldn’t have had to solve.  These are things that should have been solved for a long time.  Even on trade., We should have never allowed our past leaders — should have never allowed China to get to a point where there’s a $500 billion trade deficit with the United States.  When they went up, we should have gone up.  We should have gone up together — not where you allowed one to get so far ahead.  And that includes the European Union and it includes many others.  Shouldn’t have happened., So we came at a time where there were plenty of problems to solve, and one of the big problems is immigration.  And I hope that within not too long a distance — and I mean beyond just one problem of immigration.  You can mention the word “comprehensive,” or you don’t have to use it.  A lot of politicians don’t like the word “comprehensive immigration reform.”  But I really think we have an opportunity to redo the whole immigration picture, and that’s what I’m looking to do, ultimately.  But right now, we want to fix this problem and I think we’ll be able to do that., Does anybody else — David, do you want to say something?, SENATOR PERDUE:  Well, Mr. President, the last year and a half has shown an absolute turnaround in this economy.  I mean, we were faced with eight years of 1.9 percent economic growth.  We focused on, as John said, regulation, energy, taxes.  This year, we’ve put a Dodd-Frank bill — a bipartisan bill, and we freed up a couple trillion dollars., And what this administration has done is freed up $6 trillion to go back into the economy.  This is real jobs — 3.5 million new jobs, 870 regulations reversed.  This economy is moving.  The rest of world is paying attention., NATO has doubled their investment in terms of their military spending.  We have a new free trade agreement with Korea.  We’re heading in the right direction.  I just hope that we can focus on the priorities right now, within this trade equation, to get equal access.  It’s not right and Alibaba can do cloud computing in the U.S., and Google can’t do cloud computing in China.  And that’s what this is all about., We’ve reduced global poverty by two-thirds in the last 40 years, while poverty in the United States has remained flat.  That’s not right.  And this is moving to change that., THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Jim?, SENATOR INHOFE:  I appreciate the fact that you call attention to what’s really happening now with the economy, due to two things: the tax bill and the regulations.  You know, we’re killing people with the regulations.  But what hasn’t been said around this table, and I’m surprised, the biggest accomplishment from your administration is what you’ve done with the military., You succeeded a President who had a policy that said you can’t do anything with sequestration, with the military, unless you do it with the non-defense.  And we changed that.  We had to vote for a lousy budget bill to do it, but nonetheless, it is changed.  We’ve broken parity, and we’re now rebuilding our military., THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.  The military is really incredible.  We’re ordering new planes, new ships — all jobs too.  You know, jobs, I would say, in this case is a far second.  But we’re going to have a military like we’ve never had before, and it’s great.  $700 billion approved and $716 [billion].  And in that budget, $6 billion for opioid.  That’s an important thing, too., So a lot of progress is being made., Mike, did you have something to say?  Mike Pence?, THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I just — I know I speak for the President when I express the gratitude of this administration for the support of the members of the Senate and the House that are gathered around here.  You’ve delivered for the American people on national security and rebuilding our military; on tax cuts and regulatory reform, restoring our economy., But what the President reiterated again yesterday, and he has said every day from when he sought this office, is we have a crisis of illegal immigration.  And as the President made clear, we don’t want families to be separated.  We don’t want children taken away from parents.  But right now, under the law — and we sit with these lawmakers — we only have two choices before us:  Number one is, don’t prosecute people who come into our country illegally, or prosecute them and then, under court cases and the law, they have to be separated from their children., What I want to be clear about is we’re calling on these lawmakers, Mr. President, not just to solve this problem in a way that affirms our commitment to law and order and compassion, which we can do.  And there are proposals in the Senate and proposals in the House to do that.  But the President’s vision, articulated in his State of the Union address, was let’s solve the whole problem.  Let’s build a wall, let’s close the loopholes, let’s solve the problem for 1.8 million people that were brought into this country through no fault of their own, and let’s deal with law and order and compassion with this issue of family separation at our borders., And I would say, with great respect to the members of Congress, as the House considers legislation tomorrow and the Senate is considering legislation, the President has postponed the Congressional Picnic — we’re calling on Congress to act.  Let’s roll our sleeves up, let’s work the whole problem.  Let’s end this crisis of illegal immigration., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Does anybody else have anything to say?  Because I think we’re pretty much — yes, Adam., REPRESENTATIVE KINZINGER:  Mr. President, thank you.  And just from the House perspective, I want to say — and as a still-currently serving Guard member — you’re my Commander-in-Chief — there has been a marked difference in the security and the good feelings in the military.  They understand that we’re investing in them again, even though we’re asking them to do a lot., And secondly, security plays a big role.  So that includes border security.  And the bill that we’re going to bring up, and hopefully pass in the House this week, fully funds the border and takes care of all these issues.  And I hope the House can pass it.  And I wish Democrats would join us, because frankly, it’s a lot of stuff in there that they like, too.  It’s an 80 percent issue.  Unfortunately, I think they like the politics of this a little better., And I also want to say, we really wish you didn’t take Secretary Pompeo from the House, because he did a great job.  (Laughter.)  He’s doing a great job., THE PRESIDENT:  He’s doing a great job.  He is doing a great job.  Thank you, Adam, very much.  Appreciate it., Anybody over here?  Yes., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to echo particularly what Chairman Thornberry and Senator Inhofe said in terms of the change that we’ve seen — and Adam as well — the change we’ve seen in terms of resources for the military.  We got to make sure we don’t have another CR for the military., THE PRESIDENT:  Right., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY:  And we are working hard in the House.  We’re hopeful we’re going to pass defense appropriations bill next week in the House.  And we need to make sure that that gets taken up and passed in the Senate, and that we don’t give you another omnibus-type bill —, THE PRESIDENT:  Please.  Please, that would be very nice., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY: — that we get a straight defense appropriations bill passed and taken up.  And that will be critically important to continue the work you’ve done to rebuild the military., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Liz.  And say hello to your father, please., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY:  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  Great guy., PARTICIPANT:  Can you tell Adam to shave — (laughter.), THE PRESIDENT:  He looks good.  Handsome guy., So thank you all very much.  We appreciate it., Q    Mr. President, are you supporting (inaudible) to keep families together?  (Inaudible) executive order?, THE PRESIDENT:  We are.  We’re looking to keep families together.  It’s very important., Q    Are you signing an executive order?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to be signing an executive order.  We’re going to also count on Congress, obviously.  But we are signing an executive order in a little while.  We’re going to keep families together, but we still have to maintain toughness, or our country will be overrun by people, by crime, by all of the things that we don’t stand for, that we don’t want., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Nucor Warehouse, Auburn, NY, 2:35 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Auburn.  (Applause.), Thank you, Jason Curtis, for that kind introduction.  It’s an honor to be with you and a lot of great, hardworking Americans who are proving every day, here at Nucor Steel Auburn that steel is back in America.  (Applause.), I’m grateful for the warm welcome and grateful for the opportunity to share a few moments with all of you to talk about the progress that we’re making as a country., I’m also grateful to be joined today by a great partner for prosperity here in the state in New York and in Auburn, and a great, great champion of American steel, Congressman John Katko.  Thank you, congressman.  (Applause.), But let me begin today by bringing greetings — bringing greetings from a great champion of American steel and a proud New Yorker.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), And before I begin, let me take a moment — let me take a moment to address an issue that is, I know, much on the minds of people across this country today, the ongoing crisis of illegal immigration at our southern border.  The President spoke about it earlier today and I wanted to address it as I was gathered with you, my fellow Americans, here in Auburn., Make no mistake about it: The crisis of illegal immigration at our southern border is a direct result of the failed immigration policies — policies that have failed to secure our border — and a result of crippling loopholes in our immigration laws that too often induce vulnerable families to make a long and dangerous journey up the peninsula to attempt to illegally enter this country, resulting in a loss of their liberty and sometimes — and sometimes worse., As the President said today, “We want to solve this problem.”  We “don’t want children taken away from their parents.”, The truth is, our weak immigration laws have had dire consequences.  As the President said today, the loopholes in our immigration laws today have caused roughly half a million illegal immigrants from Central America to be released into our country since 2014, impacting American communities, American families, and American jobs., It is tragic that these failed immigration policies have created this incentive for vulnerable families and literally put vulnerable adults and children in danger.  This is simply unacceptable, and I want to assure my fellow Americans gathered here today that that’s the case.  It’s unacceptable to this administration and unacceptable to the American people., But as the President explained today, under current law we only have one of two options.  To respond to this crisis of illegal immigration, “We can either release all illegal immigrant families, including minors who show up” at our southern border, or we can prosecute “adults for the federal crime of illegal entry.”  Neither of these options solve the problem that we face today.  And that’s why President Trump, again today called on the Congress to pass immigration reform and to pass immigration right away.  (Applause.), Working with members of Congress — this week Congress will consider legislation that will build a wall, secure our border, close loopholes, and enact the kind of reforms that give us the legal authority to detain and remove families together.  And this legislation would also allow us to permanently resolve the issues surrounding individuals who are brought into this country over many years through no fault of their own., Congress will take up that legislation this week.  And I want to personally thank Congressman John Katko for taking the principles that President Trump articulated in his State of the Union Address and helping to enwrap them into legislation.  Congressman Katko, thank you for working on this issue in a principled and a compassionate way.  (Applause.), I just want to promise all of you, as the headlines continue to unfurl over the coming days, President Trump and I are going to continue to work tirelessly with your Congressman and with members of Congress to close these crippling loopholes in our immigration laws, to build a wall to secure our border, and to solve the crisis of illegal immigration once and for all.  (Applause.), Now, again, it’s an honor to be here at Nucor Steel Auburn, and particularly to see the extraordinary new rolling mill that just opened in the last year., As President Trump said, steel workers are the backbone of America.  And he knows what he’s talking about because the hardworking men and women of Cayuga County elected a builder to be President of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  This President loves men and women who know how to make things., And on behalf of that builder, I’m here today at the largest steel producer in the country simply to say thank you.  Thank you to each and every one of you who make Nucor Steel a success here in Auburn and all those you represent in this great company around America., It’s amazing to think, for almost a half a century, Nucor has been a key part of why the steel in America is the best steel in the world.  In fact, I’m told that some of the greatest buildings in this country, including One World Trade Center and Yankee Stadium in New York City, were all built with Nucor steel., Since 1974, this mill in Auburn has led the way in producing world-class rebar.  And as your recent expansion demonstrates, under President Trump, we are forging a new American future built on American steel.  (Applause.), Truth is, this mill is actually a powerful symbol — a powerful symbol of an American comeback not just in steel, but in every area of our economy.  Since the first day of this administration, President Trump and I have been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people.  We’ve rolled back federal red tape.  We’ve unleashed American energy.  I don’t know if you noticed it, but last year, as the President was approving the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, he also signed an executive order requiring all new energy pipelines be built with American steel.  (Applause.), The President has also been fighting every day for the kind of fair deals for trade that put American jobs and American workers first., As the President has said, “If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country.”  And what this President and I both understand, that to have a strong and secure America, America needs steel to be strong.  We didn’t build those battleships with plastic.  We’re going to make sure that American steel is there now and for generations to come for a stronger and more secure America.  (Applause.), And beyond steel and aluminum, the President has also made it clear that we’re going to keep fighting for other areas of this economy here in upstate New York, particularly when it comes to dairy farmers., New York’s dairy farmers are the best in the world, and President Trump is fighting for the kind of free and fair trade deal with Canada that puts American dairy farmers first.  And we’re going to keep fighting.  (Applause.), You know, the truth is, for too long Canada’s price manipulations have been impacting dairy farmers here in upstate New York.  And I can assure you the President is going to continue to use all the tools at his disposal to negotiate deals that will ensure the ongoing prosperity of our dairy farmers., And just before Christmas, I hope you all noticed — just a few days before Christmas, the President kept one of his signature promises to the American people when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.  (Applause.), Well, we know once these tax cuts take full effect the average working family of four in Central New York is going to save more than $2,400 a year in taxes., But we also cut taxes on businesses, like Nucor Steel, so that companies here in America can compete and win against companies anywhere in the world., I specifically want to thank your Congressman, John Katko, one more time, who took a strong and courageous stand for working families here in New York, for businesses large and small in New York.  Thank you, Congressman Katko, for supporting tax cuts to make this state and country great again.  (Applause.), I also, lastly, just want to thank Nucor Steel for the example that this company is setting in support of the pro-growth policies that President Trump and I and our entire administration have been advancing with the strong support of leaders in Congress.  The truth is, steel is back and Nucor Steel has proven that every day., In fact, since Election Day 2016, I’m told Nucor has already announced over $2.1 billion in new investments to upgrade new equipment.  Later this summer, you’re going to celebrate the one-year anniversary of that $30 million investment, that beautiful new rolling mill just behind me.  And all these investments Nucor Steel is making are projected to create more than 745 good-paying jobs here and all across America.  Let’s hear it for a company that’s investing in America.  Thank you, Nucor.  (Applause.), But the truth is, this company is hardly alone.  Since Election Day 2016, I’m proud to report that companies, large and small, have created 3.4 million new jobs all across this country, including 174,400 new jobs all across the state of New York., Unemployment hasn’t been this low in nearly 50 years.  And unemployment for women is at a 20-year low.  And employment for African Americans and Hispanics has never been lower.  Men and women, we’re bringing back the American Dream for every American.  (Applause.), But you know, for all that we’ve accomplished with the strong support of your congressman and other partners in Washington, D.C., for all that companies, like Nucor, have been able to do in the last year and a half, I can assure you that that New Yorker that I work with every day, that’s just what he calls a good start.  And I want to promise you: We’re going to continue to work tirelessly — we’re going to continue to work tirelessly to support American steel and American jobs.  We’ll continue to fight for an economy that’s growing, and prospering, and working for every American., And as I leave here today, inspired by the example of all of you and by a company that is investing again in American jobs and in America’s future, I leave here with renewed confidence that with your continued support and example, and your hard work in this great company, with the strong support of leaders in Congress like Congressman John Katko, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I just know in my heart that we will make America safe again.  We will make America prosperous and strong again.  And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again., Thank you, Nucor Steel.  (Applause.)  We’re proud of you.  Keep up the great work, and God bless you all.  Thank you very much., END, 2:49 P.M.

       "      <td>[U.S. Capitol, \\nWashington, D.C., 12:12 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Speaker Ryan, for that wonderful toast — although I’ve heard better jokes. (Laughter.) And thank you to all of our friends and distinguished members of Congress for joining us here today — a great honor. And a really great honor to be with you, Vice President Pence. You have been terrific. (Applause.), And all of our friends welcoming Taoiseach. That’s my new friend; he’s my new friend. Great guy. (Applause.) And, Fionnuala, you know, you are something very special. We sat, we talked, and I think we’re friends now too, right? And it’s really an honor. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thanks, Fionnuala. Appreciate it., Also, the delegation members — very, very special. Spent some time together, and we’re going to have a very, very great long-term relationship, as we would with Ireland anyway. But this is a very special group, so I very much appreciate it., We’re here today to celebrate America’s commitment to Ireland and the tremendous contributions — and I know it well — the Irish immigrants and their descendants have made right here in the United States and throughout the world. The very first St. Patrick’s Day parade — I spent a lot of time at St. Patrick’s Day parades over the years, I will tell you that – was held in my hometown, New York City, on March 17th, 1762. With each subsequent year, the Irish people marched, passed another accomplishment, and celebrated another very hard-earned success. And they have had tremendous success all over the world, but in this country they have had tremendous success., Over the years, they marched past the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, now an immortal monument to the faith of Irish Catholics in America. They celebrated their shared success in American society with the election of John F. Kennedy. (Applause.) They fought for America in war and combat. And their battlefield courage has earned admiration and acclaim throughout the world. They have great courage., The proud tradition that started in 1762 has flourished and is now celebrated by Americans of all faiths and backgrounds all across our very beautiful and very special land. As we stand together with our Irish friends, I’m reminded of that proverb — and this is a good one, this is one I like; I’ve heard it for many, many years and I love it — “Always remember to forget the friends that proved untrue. But never forget to remember those that have stuck by you.” We know that, politically speaking. A lot of us know that, we know it well. (Applause.) It’s a great phrase., The people of Ireland and the people of the United States have stuck together through good times and bad times. Over many centuries we have built a bond that thrives, inspires and endures. And with us, it’s going to be closer than ever before, I can tell you that. (Applause.), So as we celebrate our shared history and our enduring friendship, let us commit ourselves to working together, as we will, to build on that bond for the benefit of our citizens for many more generations to come., Thank you. God bless you. And may God always bless our deep and lasting friendship and relationship. We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland. Thank you very much for being here. (Applause.), SPEAKER RYAN: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It is now my pleasure to introduce An Taoiseach, our friend, Enda Kenny. (Applause.), TAOISEACH KENNY: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you., Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, members of, Congress, ambassadors, friends of Ireland, distinguished guests., (Speaks in Irish.), I didn’t say anything disparaging about you there. (Laughter.) What I said was, it’s a pleasure for me to be here, along with my wife, Fionnuala, to be amongst this august gathering. And on behalf of the government of Ireland and the people of Ireland, I wish you all a very happy St. Patrick’s festival for you all., They say the Irish have the capacity to change everything. I just saw the President of the United States read from his script, entirely. (Laughter and applause.) I was going to say “a change is coming.” (Laughter.), Paul, it’s a pleasure. And thank you for your visit to Ireland when you called to see me in government buildings with your family and on your visit down to Kilkenny. When I had the privilege of speaking to the President on the telephone very shortly after his election, I said to him if it would be possible to continue this tradition, which began so many years ago, and he said, without hesitation, of course — followed by the Vice President and U.S. Speaker., This is a unique occasion for Ireland and for its people. To have the facility of being honored by the Speaker of the House, the access to the President of the United States, the Vice President, and most of the team is something that we really do cherish. It goes back a very long way from when Tip O’Neill and Ronald Reagan and all of the others put this together in the first place. So it’s a really important day for us, and we’re very grateful to stand between these two flags, united in history and so much., I haven’t had the opportunity to present you with a particular piece of sculpture which is entitled “Arrival,” by John Behan. It’s a miniature — but it’s quite large — of what stands at the United Nations in New York of the tale and the story and the history of Irish immigrants after the famine years., So let me congratulate you, President Trump, on your election. You beat them all. (Laughter and applause.) Whatever they say, elections are tough-going. I know, I’ve been through 20 of them myself. (Laughter.) But the President and the Vice President and this administration now holds within its hands the responsibility of dealing with so many global international issues in a world that is changing so rapidly and that is so fragile in so many respects. And I know that you will do your utmost to work in the interests of our common humanity, and you will have the prayers and the support of the Irish people. And let me say to you, and the European Union — and the work that you have to do in the times — in the challenging times ahead., We discussed the kind of driver that the President uses — Titleist, 9-degree loft, Doonbeg, wind off the Atlantic. You have to roll the wrist at the top to get that shot straight. And during the course of this presidency, President Trump will visit Ireland, and he said he would put the sticks in the hold of Air Force One., Anyway, let me just say a few words here about our country. We’ve come through a torrid time a number of years ago. When I took over the government back in 2011, we were blocked out of all the markets, the Troika were in town, our sovereignty was gone, our hope was gone; hemorrhage of immigration, and a falloff in all business right across every sector., Now, because of the sacrifices of the people and tough choices made, we’re in a different spot. Unemployment, which was 15.2, is now down to 6.6 percent and falling. Employment is the highest in 10 years. A growth rate of 5.2 percent last year. Fourth year running. Ireland is the fastest-growing country in Europe. Deficit eliminated next year. Two million-plus working now. I was accused in Cork three weeks ago of blocking up the Irish roads with people going to work. (Laughter and applause.) That’s the challenge of success, I suppose., It’s fair to say, as you know, Mr. President, we’ve got 700 Irish firms, and 65 percent of the 700 firms working in America have a full-time presence in this market. And they now employ 100,000 people across 50 states. And that’s because of our participation in the European Union and the confidence that our people have to expand now beyond their own shores. And this two-way conduit is to the mutual benefit of our people and of the United States. And let me say that Ireland and the European Union will never be anything but a friend to your country, to these United States here. (Applause.), And I want you to understand that all administrations, over the last 40 years and beyond, have worked in the interests of the fragility of our country. We’ve had our troubles. We’ve had real difficulties. And George Mitchell spoke last night at the Ireland Funds about the contribution that both Europe, and particularly the United States, made towards putting that fragile peace together. We’re glad to see Ian Paisley here and, indeed, Gerry Adams, who have had their difficulties. We have put it all together and have maintained a fragile peace. And that’s why it’s important that we recognize the contribution made by the United States to that peace, where we have no border and where people can live their lives as one would expect to contribute to their country and their economies. And all presidents and all administrations over the years have assisted us in that regard. (Applause.), So we want to protect this peace process, and I know that you’re going to work with us in that context also. We have agreed with the British government that there would be no return to the border, as it used to apply years ago, with customs, posts on major roads, and every other road blown up or impassable because of sectarian violence that that brought with it. We have banished that. We want to see it remain banished. And the political agreement is no return to that kind of border of the past, and the challenge is to implement that in a way that works in the interests of the people North and South., And let me say to you that as a member of the European Council, what we want to do is to work with America. I believe genuinely, with Europe having created 4.5 million jobs in the last three years, that we can work with the United States to create more employment here, create opportunities for so many millions of Americans. And it may well be that in a revised trade agenda, that we can do that to the mutual benefit of 500 million people in the European Union and your population here across the United States. We will work with this administration, Paul and Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, in the interests of everybody., Thank you, Peter King, and thank you, Richard Neal — I know you’re here somewhere — for the work you’ve done over the years with the (inaudible). (Applause.) It may well be that it might be appropriate for the government and the administration to have a desk here in Washington which will associate itself with Northern Ireland, so that in the event of contact having to be made, that there’s a voice to answer that., You had in the past envoys appointed to Northern Ireland on practically a full-time basis. I think we can work now as a priority to get this executive up and running in the next short period. But to have continued connection here with the administration would be very important, and I’m sure Peter and Rich will work at that., I just want to say, I had a very good meeting this morning with the Vice President and with General John Kelly. Sitting at the table, we were hosted by the Vice President in the traditional breakfast in the Naval Observatory. Didn’t get much chance to eat the breakfast, I have to say; it’s one of the difficulties in politics — it’s in front of you but you can’t get near it. (Laughter.) We did discuss the question of immigration, which is so important to the fabric of our people. And I know that in this country, this is an issue that the administration and the President are reflecting upon. And that’s something that, again, we will work with you diligently in this regard in the two sectors that we used to have a facility for E3 visas for young people who want to come to America and to work here. We discussed that very constructively this morning., And secondly, as a part of the overall immigration reform that the Irish have contributed so much, it would be part of that. And we look forward to the works that will take place at the time ahead., You might say that when Mike Pence’s grandfather landed here in Ellis Island in 1923, that the contribution had been made by so many Irish for so many years. It was in 1771 that the friendly Sons of St. Patrick were put together in Philadelphia, and one of their first honorary members was a young man called George Washington. And seven years later, he handed the first commission to a naval officer called John Barry, who was co-founder of the American Navy. And he was joined later by John Holland, who designed the first submarine. And he was followed by Louis Brennan, from my hometown, who had a major impact on the navigation systems for torpedoes., And so many others, from Henry Ford, through music and culture, and so many other areas, that 22 members of the American Presidents who sat in the White House had either Scots or Irish blood in them. And you follow in that line, sir., And I’d just like to say in finality, this is what I said to your predecessor on a number of occasions: We would like this to be sorted. It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And that’s what people want. (Applause.), I know you’ll reflect on this, but I’m always struck by the American National Anthem when it’s sung before the great occasions. And I suppose being an emotional Irishman, the hairs tingle at the back of your neck when you hear your own national anthem. But for us, when Old Glory waves, and you put your hand on your heart and you say, “The land of the free and the home of the brave,” ours is still as brave as ever, but maybe not as free. Because of the 4,000 Congressional Medals of Honor given out to the defense forces, over 2,000 go to the Irish Americans. So they fought in the Revolutionary War. They beat the daylights out of each other in Fredericksburg and Gettysburg and Yorktown, and other places, in Atlanta. They fought every war for America and died for America — and will continue to do so. All they want is the opportunity to be free., And this administration, working with Democrats and Republicans, I hope, can sort this out once and for all. And for future years, you determine what it is that you want to do. As George Mitchell said last evening, you can’t return to open immigration, but for the people who are here — who should be here, might be here — that’s an issue that I’m sure your administration will reflect on. And we in Ireland will give you every assistance in that regard., There are millions out there who want to play their part for America — if you like, who want to make America great. (Laughter.) Heard it before? Heard that before? (Applause.), So I see Vicki here in front of me. We didn’t get as far as the Kennedy Center the other evening. I was talking to young people the other day, they were on about all the different things that are happening in the world, and they reminded me of one of JFK’s statements: “This is our planet. Together, we shall save or we shall perish in its flames.”, We have work to do. Let’s eat. Thank you. (Applause.), END, \\n12:31 P.M. EDT]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 3:53 P.M. EDT, SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Many by now have heard that I was asked to leave a restaurant this weekend where I attempted to have dinner with my family.  My husband and I politely left and went home.  I was asked to leave because I work for President Trump., We are allowed to disagree, but we should be able to do so freely and without fear of harm.  And this goes for all people regardless of politics.  Some have chosen to push hate and vandalism against the restaurant that I was asked to leave from.  A Hollywood actor publicly encouraged people to kidnap my children., And this weekend, a member of Congress called for people to “push back” and make clear to those serving their country in this administration that they are not welcome anywhere, anytime, for anything., Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important, but the calls for harassment and push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable., America is a great country, and our ability to find solutions despite those disagreements is what makes us unique., That is exactly what President Trump has done for all Americans by building a booming economy, with record low unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics, the defeat of ISIS, and the ongoing work to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula., Earlier today, the President spoke with the new President of Colombia and congratulated him on his recent electoral victory.  President Trump noted the strong partnership between our two countries and discussed the security challenges the new Colombian government will face as he enters office., We are also working to set up a call between the President and the President of Turkey to reaffirm our strong bond.  We encourage Turkey to take steps to strengthen its democracy and continue progress toward resolving issues in the bilateral relationship., Lastly, and on a slightly lighter and more positive note, it should be an exciting national championship at the College World Series since the Arkansas Razorbacks will be playing and take on Oregon State starting tonight in Omaha.  So, go Hogs., And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Jonathan., Q    Sarah, I want to ask you about the President’s tweet over the weekend, where he said that people who cross the border illegally should be sent back with no court cases, no judges.  Does the President believe that undocumented immigrants have no due process rights whatsoever?, SANDERS:  Virtually all Americans agree that it makes no sense that an illegal alien sets one foot on American soil and then they would go through a three- to five-year judicial process to be removed the country.  Thousands of illegal aliens are removed every month without seeing an immigration judge as a result of procedures in current law, including voluntary removal and expedited removal.  Just because you don’t see a judge, doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process., The President is focused on securing our borders and reforming our immigration system to prevent the crisis at the border from getting worse., Q    But he’s saying no judges, no court cases.  So no opportunity to claim asylum, no opportunity to have their cases heard before a judge?, SANDERS:  No, like I just said, just because you don’t see a judge, doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process.  Also, the President would like to see us stop people from illegally entering the country at all.  We’d like to have secure borders.  The Democrats are the ones that want open borders.  The President would like us to secure the borders and have a very legal and easy immigration process so people can come here the right way, not the wrong way., John., Q    Just in addition to what Jon was asking, under current law — and you spoke to this — contiguous countries to the United States, like Mexico and Canada, where people can be removed on an expedited basis, they can basically just be taken to the nearest border crossing and sent back.  Does the President want to implement that type of policy for people from noncontiguous countries?  Is that what he’s looking for here?, SANDERS:  The President would certainly like to see more expedited removal.  But ultimately, the President would like to see our border secured so that we don’t have all of these problems to begin with.  The President wants to fix our immigration system completely, and not just tinker with it.  He actually wants us to have a system that works, and he wants to have a secure border., He doesn’t believe in the philosophy that Democrats do, that we should have open borders.  He wants to stop that.  He wants to stop the crime that comes into this country.  And that’s what we’re hoping to do, and we’d like to see Congress step up and work with us., Blake., Q    The President also said in the Oval Office that people have proposed adding 5,000 judges.  Who’s proposed to add 5,000 judges?  I’ve seen 750 as a max number., SANDERS:  There have been a number of different proposals; quite a few that we’ve seen.  We’ve laid out what we would like to see, and hopefully Congress will work with us to make that happen., Blake., Q    Sarah, thank you.  Let me ask you about a couple statements on trade.  What is the President’s reaction to the Harley-Davidson announcement today?  Does he still feel that tariffs are the way to go?SANDERS:  The President’s trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy, and this includes the creation of over 300,000 manufacturing jobs.  Unemployment is at 3.8 percent, the lowest since 2000.  And manufacturing confidence is at historic highs., The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies.  And President Trump will continue to push for free, fair, and reciprocal trade and hopes that the EU will join us in that., Q    And on the story about Chinese investments — curtailing possible Chinese tech investments — the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said five hours ago that a statement would be forthcoming, and we still don’t have it.  When might that be coming?  Or what exactly is that administration’s stance on this?, SANDERS:  Again, as the Secretary said, a statement would go out that targets all countries that are trying to steal our technology, and we expect that to be out soon.  We’ll keep you posted., John., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Back on immigration.  In terms of what the President envisions for the immigration policy that he’d like to see put in place, should asylum-seekers be able to get their case heard before an immigration judge?, SANDERS:  Certainly there is a process in order to go through.  There are points of entry that asylum seekers should go to, and we encourage them to work through the system and not come across the border illegally., In fact, anyone that goes to a port of entry seeking asylum will not be prosecuted, and we would encourage people to use the correct system and not try to break the law., Q    And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they’re moving a significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the EU tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the EU and the retaliation the EU has put on the U.S.?, SANDERS:  Again, the European Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly in unfair trade practices, and the President is saying enough is enough.  We’d like to work with the EU to work on a level playing field., Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead., Q    Yes.  The President today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the King of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he didn’t give us any specifics.  There’s been quite a bit of shuttle diplomacy going on in the last few days in the Middle East with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you have anything concrete to tell us about any sort of positive movement whatsoever from all of this?, SANDERS:  Again, we think that the meetings that took place over the last week with Senior Advisor Jared Kushner and Special Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and Qatar last week., They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the peace effort.  We’re going to continue those conversations and we’re committed to the peace effort, and we’re going to keep working forward.  But those conversations were productive., Julie., Q    Sarah, the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said today that they’re no longer going to be referring people who cross the border without authorization for criminal charges if they’re traveling with children, which is essentially returned to the Obama administration practice and administrations before that.  Does the President support that approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero-tolerance approach in the first place?, Q    No, the President certainly supports keeping families together, which he has outlined several times over the last week, but he’s also called on Congress to actually fix the system.  They’re the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.  The President’s executive order has given a temporary solution to the problem, but it’s not permanent and we need Congress to step up.  We need Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this President, and let’s fix the problem at the border., Q    Can you talk about why you tweeted from your official account about the episode that you had the restaurant on Friday night?, SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I’d been reached out to by over a dozen reporters and there were multiple news stories that had already been issued.  It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any other news-of-the-day story., Jeff., Q    Sarah, you said just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you don’t get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that, specifically, and how the President envisions that this would work while still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift immigration system?, SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don’t see judges.  Sometimes that’s through voluntary removal, and sometimes that’s through expedited removal.  Again, the President’s ultimate goal would be that we have actually a secure border and people aren’t coming into the country illegally, but that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country come in through a legal system., Q    What is the President doing specifically this week to ensure that Congress passes a bill?  He spent all week in Nevada talking about — or all weekend, excuse me, on Saturday — talking about how Democrats want open borders and crime.  But specifically, has he made phone calls to Republican members in the House where the bill is pending?  Has he tried to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get a new law passed specifically, other than just railing against the current law?, SANDERS:  The President met with a number of lawmakers last week, talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they’d like to see, because the President wants solutions.  We have yet to have any of them show up, actually willing to have those conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they’d rather rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to step foot in public., The President wants to see solutions.  That’s what we’re focused on.  It’s Congress’s job to do that, and we’ve laid out very clearly that we want to be part of that and what we’d like to see in that package., Q    Is Congress doing its job on this?, SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren’t.  If they haven’t passed a law to fix the system, then they haven’t.  Republicans have laid out a number of proposals that they support.  The President has voiced his support for those., Q    The bills are going to probably fail this week though.  The Republican bills will probably fail this week., SANDERS:  That’s because no Democrat will get on board and actually support a solution., Q    (Inaudible) a Republican issue.  Republicans cannot pass these Republican bills.  What is the President doing as the leader of the party to try to get Republican —, SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren’t Republican bills.  These are bills that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these should be bipartisan.  This shouldn’t be complicated.  Look, the House has already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can’t get through the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions.  We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn’t taken then up.  Hopefully, they will.  And if they do, that will show that we actually can come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that’s what we’d like to see them do on immigration as well., Jill., Q    Can I follow up on Julie’s question about the zero-tolerance policy?  The President said last week, after signing the executive order, that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a point of the fact that the EO did not actually get rid of the policy.  How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children?, SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn’t going to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.  This will only last a short amount of time, because we’re going to run out of space, we’re going to run out of resources in order to keep people together.  And we’re asking Congress to provide those resources and do their job., Q    Some sort of a temporary solution.  Does that mean at some point you’re going to change that policy back?, SANDERS:  We’re not changing the policy.  We’re simply out of resources.  And at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to do, and that is secure our border, that is stop the crime coming into our country.  The country has made extremely clear that they don’t want open borders.  And Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans and find some solutions., Q    And then just another one.  Other people had several., SANDERS:  Sorry, Jill.  I’m going to keep going.  Annie, go ahead., Q    Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?  Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what’s being done about the resources?, SANDERS:  Again, we’re looking at every option available.  We have asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.  And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of crossing the border illegally., We’ve requested through legislation — we’re working with Congress, hopefully — to provide more resources and the ability to actually enforce the law., Ayesha., Q    I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down exactly what the President actually intends to do when it comes to this idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people don’t have judges.  But my understanding is that if you do ask for asylum, you do have certain rights.  So is there going to be a change in that policy?  Or what is this administration planning to do to make it so you don’t have to see a judge (inaudible)?, SANDERS:  I’ve addressed this a couple of times.  There are multiple instances in where you wouldn’t: voluntary removal, certain cases of expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time, the President’s ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal immigration., Q    I understand that.  But so what does that mean practically?  Like, is the President planning to do anything differently, or you’re just saying he doesn’t like the way things work now?, SANDERS:  The President has laid out what he’d like to see.  We’ve put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months ago.  We’re still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that., Q    So unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to change?  The administration is not changing anything right now when it comes to judges?, SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No.  Because we’re not the Obama administration.  We’re actually trying to enforce the laws that are on the books.  We’re actually asking Congress to do their part in the process and pass new legislation that will fix our immigration system., Q    So, but nothing is actually changing on the ground?  So this is — the President is complaining about judges and saying that we shouldn’t have all these judges, and people who come over should just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change?  He’s just saying — he’s just complaining about the process as it stands now?, SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the ability to write law, and we hope they’ll do that this week., Steve., Q    Honing in on that point, I’m trying to understand what it is the President understands about the current policy.  Because as you’ve explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the President know that when he issued the tweets?, SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a very lengthy process.  We’d like to see the process consolidated.  We’d like to see the backlog stopped.  We’d like to see our border secured., Q    Well, just to follow up — under current law —, SANDERS:  Sorry, Steve, I’m going to keep moving., Q    — there are a couple of things that the President could do.  He could expand that policy.  You’ve said that he would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the President intend to expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute?, SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal.  But ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me.  And it would stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of these additional laws., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  You began the briefing talking about the importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more than two-thirds of children from their parents?, SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the administration has to play.  Certainly the President has taken an executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize the separation of families.  We’re working hard to make sure families get to stay together, and we’re calling on Congress to help us in that effort.  And we’re continuing to focus on the reunification and making sure that the families, again, stay together and that Congress will give us a permanent solution to fix that., Q    Would you say that they’re working to make families stay together?  It was your administration that separated them in the first place., SANDERS:  It wasn’t our administration that created these laws, but it is our administration’s job to enforce it, and we’ve done that.  If someone breaks the law, it’s our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn’t like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it., Anita., Q    I have one immigration question and wanted to clarify one thing.  So, I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained together somewhere, and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I didn’t get an answer about that last week.  I don’t understand.  The law says you can’t keep them together or keep the children — even with parents — for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens?, SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass a law and fix the problem., Q    In the next 20 days?, SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they don’t want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to me., Q    I said I had a clarification., SANDERS:  Go ahead., Q    So Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.  Were you, in your response, referring to just a standalone bill that deals with family separation?  Or were you referring to the bigger immigration bill that the House is supposed to take up this week?, SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the pillars that we’ve laid out that we’d like to see addressed in an immigration package.  And that’s what our focus is right now, is there’s a bill that does that on the table.  If that doesn’t happen, then we’ll talk about other pieces of legislation at that point., Q    So the President still wants that bill to go forward even though he said they don’t want to — they shouldn’t waste their time?, SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they’re not going to support this.  And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they’ve made it very clear that they don’t want to work with the President, that they don’t want to fix our immigration system; that they’d rather have open borders and rampant crime than work with the President to create solutions., Until they change their mind, we’re going to continue looking at the best ways that we can fix these problems, but we need Congress to help us., John., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  This President is the first in the television age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said he might have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally televised address on immigration and what changes he’d like to see, to explain it.  Is that something that’s on the table within the administration?, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 3:00 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Yesterday, momentum continued to build behind our plan to deliver massive tax relief and job creation for the American people.  The House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the Senate Finance Committee passed its companion tax reform bill.  These were important moments as we move closer to a final vote., In recent months, we’ve heard from American entrepreneurs, workers, and families from every corner of our nation about how this plan will empower them to build a better life., In Pennsylvania, Susie Schlomann said that our plan will be “incredible for me and other fixed-income retirees,” because tax relief is targeted at the middle class., In Ohio, Kristina Port — a small business owner who raised twins as a single mother while launching her company — said the increase in the child tax credit would help working mothers.  She also said simplifying the complex tax code would ease the burden on entrepreneurs and allow them to devote more of their time to growing their business, rather than wrestling with their taxes., In state after state, story after story, we’ve heard how our plan will profoundly improve the lives of hardworking Americans.  The optimism is coming back, because with this tax plan — combined with the President’s efforts to eliminate job-killing regulations — Americans feel like their goals are once again attainable., It’s a reminder of one of the things that made our country unique to begin with.  Our people have always been able to visualize a future for themselves and their children and make it a reality.  That’s why it’s called the “American Dream,” and this tax plan will make it more attainable for more of our people than ever before., But for this to happen, we need economic growth that makes it possible for businesses to create jobs and raise wages.  So to give some perspective on how our tax plan is going to do that, I’ve invited Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to join us in the briefing today.  Kevin will say a few words and then take some questions specific to this topic.  And, as always, I will come back up to take the rest of your questions after that, which I’m sure will all be on tax reform.  (Laughter.), So, with that, I’ll turn it over to Kevin., MR. HASSETT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Thanks.  And it’s a pleasure to be here to see so many familiar faces.  You know, last week I had the honor of chairing the Economic Policy Committee meeting at the OECD in Paris.  And the Economic Policy Committee is one of the oldest committees in OECD, and it brings together people, like the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, from countries around the OECD., And, at the meeting, they were going through the staff recommendations of the OECD for creating economic growth in countries around the world.  And the three main points of the staff recommendations were tax reform, infrastructure, and deregulation — that if the government pursues those things, then they can produce more economic growth., In fact, there was widespread acclaim for the President’s approach towards corporate taxation in particular, because the OECD has been calling for us to reform our corporate tax code for almost a decade., And so the idea right now that this corporate tax reform is close to the finish line is celebrated not only by us at the White House, but by people around the world who have recognized that us having a non-competitive tax code, the highest corporate tax on Earth, a worldwide system that rewards companies for locating activity elsewhere, is bad not only for us but for the world economy — because a vibrant U.S. economy is good even for our friends in the OECD., And, with that, I’m pleased to see that the House Ways and Means Committee and then the House have passed this bill, and that it’s out of the Finance Committee — I look forward to the Senate moving forward right after the Thanksgiving break., And, I guess, I promised — I’m not good at this.  I don’t know what the protocol is, but I’ll start in the front row and then work back., Q    Perfect.  (Laughter.), MR. HASSETT:  Yeah, that’s right.  I’m just an economist., Q    Kevin, I know you’re an economist but there’s obviously a political component to all of this.  You got at least six senators up on the Hill, including Ron Johnson, saying that they can’t support the bill in its current form or they have serious concerns about it.  You can only afford to lose two.  Are you confident that you can get this passed through the Senate?  Or could the President run into another situation, like he did with Obamacare?  That he wins the House and then loses everything in the Senate., MR. HASSETT:  Look, there’s an old joke about economists, that there are three types:  those who can count and those who can’t.  (Laughter.)  And it takes a while for that one to sink in.  And the fact is that the President has supported, from the beginning, regular order because he doesn’t think that we have to wait until the thing becomes law to learn what’s in it; that the right thing to do is to expose the bills to scrutiny and debate., And Senator Johnson — I met with him yesterday in his office — has some serious concerns, and it’s appropriate at this point in legislative process to bring those forward.  And I’m hopeful that people can work it out and that everybody, even Democrats, will end up wanting to vote for it., And so I’m not sure about the etiquette for follow-ups, so I’ll try to limit people to one because there’s a lot of hands., Q    What makes you think trickle-down economics is going to work this time when it hasn’t worked before?, MR. HASSETT:  So trickle-down economics is something that, I guess, people who criticize the idea that taxes affect the economy will use to characterize approaches like the one that we’re pursuing.  But I don’t think the idea that’s celebrated by even the non-partisan staff of the OECD — that if you have lower marginal rates, you get economic growth — is voodoo economics or controversial at all., And yeah, the fact is that countries around the world have cut their corporate rates and had broad-based reforms, like we’re doing on the individual side, and then seeing economic growth result., I don’t think there’s anybody who thinks that you’ll get no growth or negative growth for this.  Maybe there are a few people.  But in every economic model I’ve seen, you get growth — either a lot of growth, or sometimes if it’s a closed economy model, a little growth.  But you get positive growth out of this.  And that growth will benefit workers, and let’s talk about that., So, right now, the way a U.S. firm avoids U.S. tax is they locate activity, say, in a country like Ireland instead of here.  And so if you build a plant in Ireland, then you can sell the stuff back into the U.S.  And when you sell the stuff back into the U.S., then it increase the trade deficit and doesn’t do anything for American workers, but it does increase the demand for Irish workers and drive up their wages., And so what the President wants to do is cut the rate to 20 percent and build guardrails around the tax code so that people can’t transfer price — everything to Ireland anymore.  And if we do that, then the people who benefit will be the workers here in the U.S. who have increased demand for their jobs., Q    And the incentive —, MR. HASSETT:  I said no follow-ups.  So I’m going to back this way and then I’m going to switch sides.  I’m sorry I don’t know everybody’s names here., Q    One of Senator Johnson’s concerns is that this bill does not do enough for medium-sized and small businesses.  Can you talk about what the bill does do for medium-size and small businesses?, MR. HASSETT:  Sure.  And the fact is that I want to remind everybody that the President has, really, three main non-negotiables for this bill:  that there is a 20 percent corporate tax rate; that there’s a big middle-class tax cut; and that the bill simplified the tax code.  And we believe, after analyzing the progress on the Hill, that both approaches satisfy the three main objectives., And so the question then is, moving forward, what do they do about pass-through entities?  What do they do about this, what do they do about that?  And we at the White House don’t want to get ahead of that process., The President supports regular order because that’s really how deals get made and how bills become law.  The fact is, it’s urgent that we get a 20 percent rate for America’s workers.  And it’s urgent that we get a middle-class tax cut for America’s workers.  And the details about like exactly when the small business things kick in and out are things that we’re watching them work out up on the Hill.  And we encourage them to pursue regular order because they need to listen to everybody and get the votes they need to make this law., I’ll go to the lady, right there., Q    One of the major differences between the House and the Senate bill is the elimination of the non-taxable tuition waivers.  So while they’re trying to reconcile their differences on that tax reform bill, what do you foresee which could potentially move this tax burden to a lot of young Americans?, MR. HASSETT:  That’s the kind of detail that we’re letting Congress work out.  The fact is that they’re finding the coalitions that they need to pass the bills in the House and the Senate.  And we support that process.  We support regular order.  We support the transparency that leading debate about issues like this., Sorry, now I said I’d come over here.  Yeah., Q    Kevin, thanks for being here.  On one of your TV appearances yesterday, you said that an average family, when this is all said and done, could accumulate a savings benefit of $4,000.  That’s a lot of money., MR. HASSETT:  That’s a lot of money., Q    Can you walk us through that?, MR. HASSETT:  Sure.  And for those of you — and I see some nerdy-looking people out there, so I’m sure that there’s people that want to do this — (laughter) — that we’ve got two CEA reports that go through this in gory detail.  And the fact is that you can get to numbers like that four different ways., I won’t try to do that now in the limited time that we have, but the basic idea is that back when we increased our corporate tax rate from 34 to 35 percent, we were kind of in the middle of the pack of OECD nations.  Subsequently, what happened was that countries around the world found that when they cut the corporate tax, that their economic activity increased and the welfare of their workers improved.  And then they very often did it again., A typical country, since our tax increase, has cut its corporate rate two or maybe even three times.  And for economists, what that does is it gives us an enormous amount of data to analyze because there are countries that change their rate and countries that don’t.  And you can compare the experiences of those two types of countries., There’s a big peer-review literature that looks at that, including a paper that’s by a German economist — that’s about to come out in the American Economic Review.  And what we do is we go through all those papers and we have charts that show, well, if this paper is true, what wage effect do you get.  And most of the action is well north of $4,000.  And that’s where the number comes from., I’ll go in the middle, with the orange tie., Q    One of the criticisms, Kevin, of the tax reform proposal is that the corporate tax rate is cut permanently.  The individual tax rate phases out after 10 years.  Why, in your view, is that such a good idea?, MR. HASSETT:  So the President supports permanent tax cuts for the middle class and permanent tax cuts for corporations.  And that’s certainly the objective of the planners of this tax bill.  But there are also Senate budget rules and reconciliation rules that are required to allow this bill to move forward with 51 votes., Of course, the hope for everybody is that when the time comes for these things to expire, that they get extended, as happens — I might add — even for the top marginal rate when President Obama came into office.  And so they extended most of the Bush tax cuts.  But even the top rate, at the beginning — which interestingly they must have done because they knew that if you were to increase the top marginal tax rate during a recession, that it would be very harmful for the economy., So, back then, there was bipartisan support for the idea that you should not lift the top marginal rate.  And so there should be bipartisan support.  There would be economic growth effects of bringing it down right now., I’ll go back down into the middle there., Q    Hi, Emma Robinson, One America News.  The two bills are different in that the House bill repeals or does away with the estate tax and the Senate doesn’t.  And I know that was a big point for the administration, and Vice President Pence has voiced his support for repealing the death tax, as they call it.  What are your thoughts on that?  And do you think a final bill will include a repeal of it?, MR. HASSERTT:  I think that — again, that’s one of the things that the Senate and the House are working out.  I know that the President very strongly favors the elimination of the death tax.  And if that is in the final bill, I’m sure that he’ll be happy about that.  But he’s listed his non-negotiables, and those non-negotiables I cited at the beginning., I’ll go back to the far back now., Q    Thank you, Kevin.  I appreciate it.  Can you talk about this moment earlier in the week at the Wall Street Journal event?  Gary Cohn was on stage, and the moderator asked a group of CEOs, “If tax reform passes, who here is going to increase their investment?”  And only a couple of hands went up in the room.  Gary Cohn said, why aren’t there more hands going up?, Can you answer that question?  Why aren’t there more hands going up in a room like that?  You would assume that CEOs would say, yes, in fact, we are going to invest more if tax reform passes.  Is the administration missing something there?, MR. HASSETT:  So that’s a great question.  And I went on a little bit after Gary Cohn, and when they asked that question, it was kind of hard for me because, like here, they are really bright lights, but even brighter there, and so I couldn’t quite see how many hands there were.  But when I was there, it looked like maybe about half the hands went up.  And I think if you go back and look, that it could be that people had time to think about it., But as an economist, if I go back and look at the academic literature, very often people survey CFOs, and they say, hey, if we change the tax code, would you guys do anything?  And they tend to always answer “no” in surveys.  But if you look at the hard evidence about what they do, imagine if they didn’t respond to taxes, then they wouldn’t be pursuing their fiduciary duty to maximize profits for their shareholders.  So it would be totally irrational for them to do that.  And firms that did act rationally in response to the tax code would put them out of business by taking advantage of the tax code., So the point is — the hard evidence is that people do respond.  In fact, one of my very, very first papers that I ever wrote when I got out of grad school is the Brookings papers where we looked at the 1986 tax act, the changes that it made to the business tax code and how it affected investment.  And there were very large effects., Right here in the front., Q    Yes, yes.  Gene Sperling, who was once in your position in another administration, says that this tax plan — be it historic — costs $1.5 trillion and it’s a deficit hole.  And he says that basically — this is in a tweet.  I’m just paraphrasing his tweet.  He says, it basically doesn’t justify that cost for 100 million households for a tax increase., MR. HASSETT:  Well, I respect Gene a great deal and consider him a friend, and I disagree with him about that.  And I’m sure we’ll at some point have a chance to talk about that., But here’s the way I think about it and what I would say to Gene if he was here:  That if you look at the Joint Tax Committee’s score, in the 10th year they say that the tax bill costs about $170 billion.  If you look at the CBO projection of GDP, then in the 10th year GDP is about $28 trillion.  And so the amount of deficit that you’re talking relative to GDP in the 10th year is only 0.6 percent.  It doesn’t take a heck of a lot of economic growth to cover that hole by the 10th year., And so the idea that right now we have the highest corporate tax on Earth generating almost no revenue — because people avoid the tax by moving factories to Ireland — that if we fix that, if we repair it and make the U.S. an attractive place again, that it’s going to blow a hole in the deficit — it’s just not economically rational., And I know that the Joint Tax Committee score says what it says, and I respect the professionals in that staff, but the fact is that the OECD has a study, which we’d be happy to email you, that says that the U.S. in the corporate tax space is on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve; that we’ve got such a high corporate tax rate that we’re chasing business offshore and losing revenue., And so the idea that this blows a hole in the deficit I think is just incorrect., I’ll go to the purple tie., Q    I want to pick up where John, right in front of me, left off when he asked about the phase-out on the individual side.  You’re an economist; however, the two answers that you gave were both political.  One, there’s reconciliation rules.  And two, hopefully politicians down the line solve it.  But like I mentioned, you’re an economist.  So can you not make an economic argument as to why this is good economically for people?, MR. HASSETT:  Oh, is it good for things to expire?, Q    Correct.  Is there an economic argument as to why this is good for the country as it stands right now to expire within eight years or so?, MR. HASSETT:  If you lower marginal tax rates, broaden the base, lower rates, give the middle class a tax cut, if you cut the corporate rate — if you do any of those things, they’re positive for economic growth.  And they’re less positive for growth if they expire., Expensing is kind of a strange thing in the sense that if you have expensing for a year, if you go back and look at U.S. history, very often in recessions, they’ll put in expensing for a year to try to stimulate the economy.  When expensing expires, it could actually have a short-run stimulus because people try to buy capital before the thing goes away., But for the most part, permanent tax cuts are far more impactful than things that expire — which is why if you go back and look at the Obama administration, when they were here during the beginning of the Great Recession, they even extended the Bush tax cuts at the top because they understood this., Can I go right here?  And then I’ll come to you, and then that might be the last question because Sarah is standing., Q    I actually want to follow up on that, though.  You all made a value judgment to make the corporate tax cuts permanent and to make the individual tax cuts expire, even though you want all of them to be permanent.  What’s the rationale for having corporations have that certainty of knowing that they don’t have to worry about what’s going to happen in Washington while families are going to have to worry about what politicians do six, seven years now?, MR. HASSETT:  Sure.  Well, those are the kind of things that are being worked out by Congress in order to create a bill that under Senate and House rules can become law.  And the non-negotiables for us are both met in both bills, and we consider that good news.  But the choices that the Senate has to make in order to acquire a coalition to make this law are choices that the Senate has to make.  And we don’t want to get in front of that process., Q    You don’t see the value one way or the other, whether the corporate tax cuts versus —, MR. HASSETT:  I think tax cuts that are permanent, of course, will have large positive effects., I’ll give you the last., Q    Kevin, you’ve melded politics and economics here quite successfully, and I want to ask you a political and economic question.  You’ve talked about growth covering what the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee say could be a deficit hole, a deficit implication of $1.5 trillion.  That is going to be measurable over time.  There’s going to be a means by which either dynamic scoring or static scoring answers that question., And since it’s on the mind of some of your undecided Republican senators, is this administration willing to commit to a review five years in to see if the growth models have held along your lines and the deficit implications aren’t as large — or, if they aren’t, to reassess these tax cuts in order not to blow a hole in the deficit?, MR. HASSETT:  You know, I have not discussed with the President, and I don’t think Sarah has, what we’re willing to commit to in terms of what we do five years from now.  But I can tell you —, Q    Do you think there would be —, MR. HASSETT:  But let me talk about what we can be clear about today, which is that, as the President came into office, the President’s opponents were saying that 2 percent growth was inevitable, that we were stuck in a secular stagnation; that the President’s policies couldn’t deliver 3 percent growth, and that it was a cockamamie idea to assert it., We’ve had two quarters in a row of 3 percent growth.  If you look at the fourth quarter data, it’s suggesting — at the Atlanta Fed, they have GDPNow, which is about 3.2 as of yesterday.  So it’s saying that we’re growing at 3 percent.  If we take that momentum into next year and add a tax cut, then we’re quite confident that one should be able to expect sustained growth at that level or above., With that, I think I have to hand it back to Sarah.  Thank you so much for being so gracious with your questions., MS. SANDERS:  Thank you, Kevin.  Major, he’s right, I haven’t spoken to the President about that.  But I do appreciate that you know that the President will still be here in five years.  So, I like that vote of confidence that you would know that we will be here to take that review, and we’ll be sure to raise that with him., Let me go back here., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  I have a non-Roy Moore question for you.  Can you say definitively — I want to ask you about Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri.  Can you say definitively, from this podium, that he has not been held hostage by the Saudis?  And does the President plan to speak to Prime Minister Hariri at all?, MS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware of any anticipated conversations.  That’s something I’d have to check on and get back to you.  And I don’t have any further comment beyond that at this point right now.  And I would refer you to the State Department on specifics of that., Cecilia., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  If it’s fair to investigate Al Franken and the allegation made by his accuser, is it also fair to investigate this President and the allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by more than a dozen women?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think that this was covered pretty extensively during the campaign.  We addressed that then.  The American people, I think, spoke very loud and clear when they elected this President., Q    But how is this different?, MS. SANDERS:  I think in one case, specifically, Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing, and the President hasn’t.  I think that’s a very clear distinction., Major., Q    So I want to revisit something we discussed yesterday.  You said, one of the ways that Alabama voters might be able to figure out if these allegations against Roy Moore are true is in the court of law.  That’s a direct quote from you.  There’s no criminal means by which that could happen.  So are you suggesting that Roy Moore sue the accusers in order to hash this out in court?, MS. SANDERS:  That would be something that I would refer to him to make that decision.  That’s not something I would be able to advise on., Q    But that’s the venue you meant when you talked about “in the court of law.”, MS. SANDERS:  I said that’s one option, one way to determine that process.  But that would be a decision that he would have to make, certainly not one I’m going to make., ...]</td>\n",

EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)  What a group.  What a group.  Thank you.  (Applause.), Thank you very much.  And I have to say, I don’t know if you know, you broke the all-time record.  Last year was your record, and I was here too.  (Laughter.)  And the year before that, you didn’t do so well, and I wasn’t here.  (Laughter.)  You went from $18 million, which is good — not great — to $30 million last year.  And this year — and I think that was some kind of an all-time record, by the way.  So you have to be proud.  But this year we did $32 million.  So that’s quite a record.  (Applause.), And it really is wonderful to be here with so many friends and colleagues, and really true and great American patriots., I want to begin by thanking our incredible House leadership team, Speaker Paul Ryan.  Paul, thank you.  Thank you, Paul.  (Applause.), A wonderful man who I’ve gotten to know very well — what a personality — Kevin McCarthy.  Where’s Kevin?  Where is — stand up, Kevin.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Kevin., A man who’s got more courage than all of us, Steve Scalise.  (Applause.)  Steve.  You don’t have to stand.  Look at him.  Kevin, he got up faster than you did.  I don’t know what’s — (laughter)., Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Cathy.  Cathy.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Great job, Cathy., NRCC Chair Steve Stivers — a general.  I didn’t even know about that.  I’m impressed.  (Applause.)  I don’t know if I like that or your political career better, but they’re both very good.  Thank you, General., And tonight’s dinner chair, Congressman Tom Emmer.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Great job.  $32 million — I guess you did a good job.  (Laughs.)  We did it together.  (Laughter.)  He was so generous.  He said, “You did it.”  Nope, we did it together.  That’s the way we’re working, right?  It’s the way we’re — thank you very much, Tom., Our Republican majority is one of the most successful in the history of the United States Congress.  Now, we must work to keep our majority so we can keep up the fight for American workers, American security, and the American values enshrined in our glorious Constitution and in our great American flag.  (Applause.), This year, in this election, we are fighting to win, and we are going to win.  Just no reason why we shouldn’t win with what we’ve done over the last year.  No reason whatsoever., We love our country.  We cherish our liberty.  And we always put America first.  If you notice, we’re doing that on trade.  We’re doing that on a lot of things.  (Applause.)  America first.  It’s about time.  It’s about time., Our agenda is already exceeding our highest expectations.  We’ve actually accomplished more than we said we would, and that’s been a long time since you’ve heard that.  We’ve accomplished a lot more.  They said it the other night, that Donald Trump actually has accomplished more than he said he would.  So that’s a good feeling.  And it wasn’t even a friend that said that the other night, which is really a good feeling., We’ve created more than 3 million new jobs since the election.  And if we would have said that number prior to the election, nobody would have believed it possible.  Jobless claims are at — think of it — jobless claims are at a nearly 50-year low.  Fifty years.  (Applause.)  That’s an amazing statistic., African American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded.  (Applause.)  And I have to tell you, the fake news about two weeks ago got me on that one.  Because, two months ago, it was the lowest level ever recorded.  Then, about four weeks ago, it went slightly not as good.  And I made a speech; I said, “African American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded.”  And it really wasn’t.  It was good, but it wasn’t.  And they got me.  They said it wasn’t so., But then, here’s what happened.  Last week, it went back down to the lowest levels ever recorded.  So we have it.  (Laughter and applause.)  So we have it, right?  It makes us feel good.  That’s an important one.  And here’s another one: Hispanic American unemployment has also reached historic lows — lowest ever recorded.  (Applause.)  And women: The lowest levels in 18 years.  (Applause.), Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, and I’ve been talking on the campaign trail for so long that wages have been stagnant for 18, 20, and even 21 years., Confidence is the highest in history.  In the history of our country, confidence for manufacturers is the highest.  (Applause.)  And you see it: Companies are moving back.  Chrysler is moving back to Michigan from Mexico.  You look at so many different companies.  Foxconn, they make a lot of the Apple products.  Great products.  They’re moving to Wisconsin., We have massive companies moving back in.  They all want to be back in.  American producers in the mining, construction, and manufacturing industries gained more jobs in February than in any month in nearly 20 years.  Think of that.  (Applause.), I mean, do you ever hear numbers like this?  And these are really numbers that we’re getting right out of the manual.  This is it.  It’s hard to believe.  These are incredible numbers.  That’s why we should do great when we run in a very short period of time., The economy is booming, and it’s booming because we passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history.  (Applause.)  Biggest in American history., And when they came to me — because not since Ronald Reagan has anything been close — and when they came to me, they said, “We’re going to pass tax reform.”  I said, “Why hasn’t it been done in 38 years?”  They said, “We don’t know, you just can’t do it.”  And I said, “Well, it doesn’t make sense.  You’re cutting taxes. Why?”  “Well, sir, I don’t know, but here’s the bill.  It’s tax reform.  It says tax reform.”, And I said, “There’s something wrong.  How come it hasn’t happened?”  And I said, “You know, I think I have the idea.  Don’t call it tax reform.  Call it tax cuts.”  It was never called tax cuts.  And they said, “Well, what is that?”  I said, “Tax reform might mean you’re reforming taxes and you’re going to raise taxes.  Nobody knows what it means.  So call it tax cuts.  And in fact, let’s call it the Tax Cut, Cut, Cut bill.”  (Laughter.), And Paul Ryan wouldn’t do it.  You know, he’s a classy guy.  He said, “That’s just — I can’t do it.”  (Laughter.)  So we called it the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  And that’s fine, right?  (Applause.), And I see Kevin Brady here someplace.  Where’s Kevin?  Stand up, Kevin, please.  (Applause.)  He doesn’t stop.  And let’s not tell anybody, although you have a lot of cameras back there, actually.  Let’s not tell anybody, Kevin, about phase two that we’ve already started on, right?  Phase two tax cuts.  Right?  (Inaudible.)  (Applause.)  Thank you, Kevin., More than 6 million Americans have already received a tax cut bonus or a pay raise, and that is just the beginning.  I want to thank everyone who made this incredible victory possible, including so many friends that worked with Kevin and myself, people in Congress, great senators, great congresspeople.  You are really incredible, so enjoy it because we’re going to start, probably, on Monday, with Kevin and myself and everybody on doing it again., And I just want to thank you.  And on behalf of Paul, and Kevin, and my other Kevin, my — I don’t know, I think Brady, maybe, is better looking than Kevin.  I don’t know.  (Laughter.), But we really are.  We really — I have to thank the people in this room because you really made it possible.  And you worked hard, and you just wouldn’t stop, and you wouldn’t take no for an answer.  A lot of obstacles.  You wouldn’t take no for an answer., But while Republicans were fighting to reduce taxes for hardworking Americans, the Democrats were fighting to increase taxes.  That’s what they want to do.  They’re actually working right now to increase taxes.  And I’m saying, “How do you lose to that?”  (Laughter.)  They want to increase taxes.  Maybe they’ll call that tax reform.  (Laughter.), Every single Democrat in Congress opposed our middle class tax cuts.  And if Democrats were to gain control of the House, the first thing they would do is raise your taxes.  They would raise your taxes.  They would take away what we’ve done and raise your taxes.  And actually, I’ve seen some of the numbers — very substantially raise your taxes., Republicans also repealed one of the nation’s cruelest and most unfair taxes ever: the Obamacare individual mandate.  (Applause.), And the mandate is gone forever.  And that’s a beauty.  You pay a lot of money not to have to pay and not to get healthcare.  So you’re paying not to have healthcare.  I mean, that wasn’t so good.  But we got rid of it., And you know, included — that nobody even talks about — is ANWR in Alaska, one of the great sites of energy in the world.  And I didn’t think it was a big deal.  And then one day, a friend of mine who was in the oil business called.  “Is it true that you have ANWR in the bill?”  I said, “I don’t know.  Who cares?  What is that?”  (Laughter.)  “What does that mean?”, They said, “No, is it true?”  I said, “What does it mean?  What’s the big deal that they did put it in?”  He said, “Well, you know, Reagan tried, every single President tried, and not one President was successful in getting it.  The Bushes weren’t — everybody.”, I said, “You got to be kidding?  I love it now.”  And after that we fought like hell to get ANWR.  (Laughter.)  He talked me into it — (applause) — and he didn’t care, but he said it was amazing., So by itself, that would have been a big bill.  But that was included.  And we’re doing great, by the way, on energy.  We are now an exporter of energy.  Can you believe that?  (Applause.)  Ten million barrels, folks.  We just cracked ten million barrels., We’ve also ended the crushing onslaught of federal and other regulation.  That’s a big deal.  (Applause.)  And I hate to say it to Kevin, but some people consider what we’ve done on regulation as important and some even more important than the tremendous tax cuts because the regulations were killing our country.  They were killing us.  (Applause.), Together, we have set a record for cutting the red tape — passing a record number of bills to permanently remove job-killing regulations.  All over the country, they’re building now where they had no chance of getting going., Even if you look at the pipelines — immediately upon taking office, I let the pipelines go — Keystone, you know, both of them.  And we let them proceed.  Forty-eight thousand jobs, and we’re going to have two great, environmentally friendly pipelines.  Really great.  Forty-eight thousand jobs.  That was an easy one.  But they would have never been built., We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.  (Applause.), And thanks to this Republican Congress, we’re transforming the VA to keep America’s promise to our brave, incredible, beautiful veterans.  (Applause.), And I want to thank Chairman Phil Roe.  Our Republican majorities sent me legislation that has been incredible — really incredible.  You know, we have VA accountability.  They’ve been trying to get this for 30 years — accountability.  Sounds easy.  But VA accountability, and we got it passed.  That means that people that are very bad — they’re bad in many ways; they’re even sadistic.  You couldn’t fire people from the VA.  Now, you look at them, they do a bad job, they do something wrong, they hurt our veterans — we look at them, and we say, “Jim, you’re fired.  Get the hell out of here.”  (Applause.)  I made a lot of money with that phrase.  That was a great one.  (Laughter.), But Congressman Roe, where are you?  Congressman Roe.  Congressman, thank you, great job.  Great job.  Thank you.  It’s really moving along.  And choice is coming.  Choice — where the veterans can actually — instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks, they can actually go and see a doctor and have it taken care of, and we pay.  (Applause.)  And that’s going to be the big one.  Do you agree with that, Phil?, Because of Republican leadership that all of you helped make possible, America is safer and America is much stronger.  Our military is now better funded, better equipped, and better prepared to defeat any foe that dares to threaten our country or our people., America is being respected again on the world stage.  We’re rebuilding our very depleted military — $700 billion.  And next year, $716 billion.  (Applause.)  We had to do it.  And obviously, defense is number one, but you know what else it is?  Jobs.  Lots of jobs, because we build our equipment.  So it’s lots of jobs., For the last eight years, Democrats apologized for America.  Republicans, on the other hand, are standing up for America.  (Applause.)  Right?  We’ve seen a lot of apologies.  Last eight years, we’ve seen a lot of apologizing.  Not any longer.  We don’t apologize.  (Applause.)  Took a little while to figure that one out., It has been an incredible year for our country and for the Republican Party.  And the accomplishments of our party in Congress are even more impressive because Democrats have stood in the way of progress every single day., Do you know, we have hundreds of people that cannot come into the administration because they’re being slow-walked by the Democrats in the Senate?  Last count, it was 270 people.  Now the only thing good about that — in the private sector they would like it.  They would say we’re cutting payroll., But here, we want to get them — in the State Department.  And one of your originals, Mike Pompeo, will be, hopefully, very soon, our new Secretary of State.  (Applause.)  He’s going to do a great job.  Mike is going to do a great job., Not only did Democrats universally oppose tax cuts, but every single Democrat voted no on better healthcare.  They voted no.  Every single one.  The one thing they do great is obstruct.  They’re great at obstruction.  They’re wonderful at sticking in a bloc.  They rarely break up, although I think we’re going to break them up a little bit because a lot of them are saying nice things about me in certain states that we won by a lot, and they’re running in races.  You know about that, right?, But they really are a bloc.  They just vote no.  And I don’t think people want that when it comes time to elect.  They don’t want to fix our healthcare system.  They don’t want DACA.  They do not want DACA because they think it might be a good political issue, and we want DACA.  And DACA is very much tied to the wall, and we have to have the wall.  For the drugs that are pouring into our country, and for the people that we don’t want in our country, we’re going to have the wall.  (Applause.), But they don’t want DACA.  They really don’t.  They want to use it as a political football.  And guess what?  I think it plays better for us than it does for them because we want to do something for the 800,000, and they don’t.  So it’s been a little bit of change of position, and we’re going to win that one every time.  But we’re also getting the wall., Nearly every Democrat voted against a ban on late-term abortion, when unborn babies can feel the pain.  The late-term abortion ban is commonsense policy, supported by almost two-thirds of the American people.  But virtually every Democrat voted in lockstep against protecting these innocent lives., On issue after issue, House Democrats are way outside of the American mainstream.  Nowhere in the Democrats’ extremism — and nowhere can you see anything displayed more clearly than on immigration.  A vote for House Democrats is truly a vote for open borders — people pouring into our country, pouring in.  We have no idea who they are.  They’re coming in — open borders.  You look at sanctuary cities, where criminals are protected., If House Democrats control the committees and control the floor, they will block every single effort to secure our borders and to defend our communities., Nearly every House Democrat voted in favor of sanctuary cities.  They voted to release criminal aliens to prey on innocent American lives.  Republicans believe our cities should be safe havens for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens or illegal immigrants.  (Applause.), It’s time for Congress to stop funding sanctuary cities so we can restore the rule of law.  (Applause.)  The American people are with us.  Let’s fight to save those incredible American lives.  And you see what’s happening.  You see the slaughter.  You see the kind of killing and hurt and pain.  And we are fighting very hard, and I think we’re doing one hell of a job.  And you look at our borders, and you see the difference in the numbers.  But the laws are not helping us, because we have some laws that are very much against everything that we stand for in this room., House Democrats also voted against Kate’s Law -– a commonsense bill authored by Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  Where’s Bob?  Bob.  (Applause.)  Bob.  Thank you, Bob.  And that bill has been sitting for a long time over there, Bob, hasn’t it?  It’s too bad., They voted against legislation to keep gang members like MS-13 out of our country.  These are extreme and dangerous positions.  They make no sense., So here is our message from the coming election to the American people: If the Democrats ever got back into power, they would vote to raise your taxes; release dangerous criminals; open your borders; shut down this great surge of American energy that is tremendous for jobs, tremendous for the economic wellbeing of our country, and, frankly, helping the world.  They would take over American healthcare; take away your Second Amendment; and ship away your jobs to other countries, like has gone on for so many years.  And those days are over.  Those days are over.  (Applause.), The world, including our friends, has been taking advantage of the United States of America.  We can’t allow that to happen anymore.  We just can’t.  We want our jobs to be here.  We want our great factories, our great plants to be here.  We don’t want people fired and watch a company leave our country, make a product somewhere nearby, ship it back into our country, not be taxed, and all we get out of it is unemployment and pain.  Not going to happen anymore.  That’s why so many companies are moving back.  (Applause.)  They’re moving back.  First time in many, many decades., That’s why we need strong Republican majorities.  (Applause.)  It doesn’t matter what Democrat candidates say on the campaign trail because once Democrats get to Washington, they always do the same thing: They vote for the liberal Pelosi agenda down the line, straight down the line every single time.  They will never vote for us.  They will never vote for what’s right., These days, there’s no such thing as a Blue Dog Democrat, a Red State Democrat, or a Conservative Democrat because they are all Pelosi Democrats: weak on crime, weak on terrorism, and weak on national defense.  (Applause.), And on terrorism, in Iraq and Syria, we’ve taken back almost 100 percent, in a very short period of time, of the land that they took.  And it all took place since our election.  We’ve taken back close to 100 percent., Democrats like to campaign as moderates, but they always govern like radicals.  That is why I am going to campaign all across this country to elect Republicans so that we can reduce taxes further; reduce crime; increase jobs; and make our communities safe, and prosperous, and secure., And I’ll be all over the country.  Kevin, you’ll get me all over.  Where is our Kevin?  You’re going to get me all over the country, Kevin?  (Applause.)  And I’ll be complaining every single trip.  (Laughter.)  But I’m going to get there., We are going to keep criminals off our streets and terrorists — we’re going to keep them the hell out of our country.  (Applause.), Our opponents are fielding the most candidates they’ve ever had in a quarter century.  Many have not held office before, which means it will be easier for them to conceal their true beliefs.  You’re not going to know anything about these people., That’s why we must tell the truth over and over again: A vote for a House Democrat is a vote for higher taxes, open borders, and the destruction of American jobs and American wealth.  It’s also the destruction of the American Dream.  It’s a dream, and they’re destroying that beautiful dream., But to win, we have to out-work the opposition.  For some reason, when a party wins the presidency — incredible — what happens is they lose two years later.  And I know what happens, I figured — you know, I could never understand — like, 95 percent of the time they end up losing the midterms.  It’s called complacency., Nobody has explained it.  I couldn’t understand why — you win the presidency, you think it’d — and we do record business.  The economy is maybe the best it’s ever been ever, I think — ever.  How has it ever been better?  (Applause.), The stock market is at an all-time high, jobs are the number one — 154 million jobs.  That is the most jobs in the history of our country.  We have, right now, the most jobs.  (Applause.), We need more people, if you can believe it.  We’re going to have an incredible expansion.  But it’s called complacency.  Because you win the presidency, you work so hard.  Look how hard we worked.  You work, you work, you work, and you win.  And now you take it easy a little bit.  “Oh, I’m so happy we won.  That was so hard.”  And then a year goes by, and now, all of the sudden, you’re running again.  And you get complacent, and you lose., But then what happens — oh, boy, are we going to — are we going to win 2020.  But we have to worry about ’18 before we worry about ’20.  (Applause.)  But there is a complacency, and I can understand it.  It’s natural — human trait.  But we cannot be complacent.  We can’t.  We have so much to gain, and this country has so much to lose., So we have to remember — you know, we have a short period of time now.  We have to remember., And the other thing is, you know, we had five races up until last week.  And of the five races, we won all five.  These people back here expected us to lose a couple of those races, maybe more than that.  We won.  They didn’t know what to do., So they said, “We didn’t win by as much as we were supposed to.”  And, by the way, if we won by more, they would’ve found a reason.  So we’re fighting the press, we’re fighting the media; we always will, for whatever reason.  But we’re 5 and 0, and then we lost by 300 votes the other night, right?  Three-hundred out of two-hundred-and-twenty-some-odd-thousand votes.   Three-hundred votes., And I will tell you, though, that area in Pennsylvania and all of Pennsylvania and all other states — they’re energized because I made a speech there two nights before, and I’ll tell you what — that crowd was — they were going.  They really — they were happy.  They were thrilled.  I wish I was running.  Boy.  (Laughter.)    Man.  That was some energetic group.  And it was close.  It was really close.  We went in there; they were down.  Good man — Rick Saccone.  Good man.  And didn’t quite make it.  But lost — think of it — lost by about 300 votes out of all those votes.  So it’s pretty incredible.  But we can’t let it happen.  We have to win.  There’s nothing like winning.  We have to win., Now, the last election, we defied every expectation and totally proved the pundits wrong.  Right?  They said, “There’s no way to 270.”  Remember that?  (Applause.)  “There is no way to 270.”  And everybody believed them.   I even believed them.   I said, you know, it doesn’t look good.  I heard this for six months.  “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.”  I kept hearing that, right?  (Applause.)  And I said, “I think I’m doing well, but they’re showing me a little down in Ohio.”  And I said, “Man, I guess you can’t win if you can’t win Ohio.”  So I went to Ohio — we have great people.  Those are great people.  Now, we really won Ohio by a lot, right?  (Applause.)  We won Ohio by a lot.  And we won Iowa by a lot., And we ran the East Coast because, you know, we have a tremendous disadvantage in presidential elections with the Electoral College.  Much easier to get the popular vote, but it’s a very much different campaign.  It’s like somebody that trains for the 100-yard dash and trains for the mile.  It’s a much different thing.  But we just ran out the East Coast, and it was a thing of beauty.  But they all said we couldn’t do it.  Now they say the midterms.  Here come the midterms.  And, as usual, they say, “Well, 95 percent of the time it doesn’t happen.”  But nobody has ever had an economy like this.  Nobody has ever had a military that’s getting so much stronger so fast.  Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.  The people in this room have done it.  Nobody has ever done it., We sent a message straight to the media, to the lobbyists, and to the powerbrokers that this city doesn’t belong to you; it belongs to the American people.  That’s what the message was.  (Applause.), Now, I shouldn’t say it to the people in this room — (laughter) — because, you know, a couple of you are a little marginal about this.  But I came up with this expression — it’s called, “Drain the swamp,” right?  Drain the swamp.  And I hated it.  (Applause.)  No, no.  I hated it.  And it was a speech during the campaign, and it was a term that was actually give to me.  Usually, I like to think them up myself, but this was given to me.  Which bothered me, too.  (Laughter.)  I never liked that., But they had this expression, “Drain the swamp,” and I hated it.  I thought it was so hokey.  I said, “That is the hokiest — give me a break.  I’m embarrassed to say it.”  And I was in Florida with 25,000 people going wild, and I said, “And we will drain the swamp.”  The place went crazy.  (Laughter.)   I couldn’t believe it.  And then, the next speech, I said it again.  And they went even crazier.  “We will drain the swamp.”  I hate that, especially these people right here.  (Laughter and Applause).  They’re saying, “Oh, please don’t say this, Mr. President.”  Don’t worry.  Close your ears.  “We will drain the swamp.”  And every time I said it, I’d get the biggest applause.  And after four or five times, I said, “Boy, what a great expression.  I love saying it.  You know?”  (Laughter.)   It’s amazing.  It really is amazing., But this city does belong to loyal, hardworking, taxpaying Americans.  And with your help, with the help of the hard work of everyone in this room — and you do work hard; it’s a tough job.  Politics is nasty.  I used to say, “The toughest people are real estate developers in New York City.”  And now I say, “You guys are babies.”  (Laughter.)  They come to see me, “Hi, Don.”  I say, “You are nothing.”  (Laughter and Applause).  These politicians are brutal.  “We got a leak.  We got a this.  We got a that.  We got a horrible false story on the front page of every newspaper.”  No, no, no.  Real estate developers are no longer the toughest people.  Politicians in Washington are the toughest people.  (Applause.)  Not even — it’s not even close., But we’re going to defy the predictions once again.  We will keep the House majority.  (Applause.)  And we will keep fighting for the change the American people want and they deserve.  The Democrats think they’re invincible.  I mean, I watch this Maxine Waters.  You ever see Maxine Waters?  (Laughter.)   A low-IQ individual.  (Applause.)  Low IQ.  “We will impeach him.  We will impeach him.”  “But he hasn’t done anything wrong.”  “It doesn’t matter.  We will impeach him.”  (Laughter.)   This is what we’re going to have.  This is what we’re going to have to fight against.  It’s easier just keep going good.  We’re going to keep the economy strong., The truth is, the Democrats never have been more vulnerable because they’ve lost touch with normal, everyday working people.  Democrats haven’t learned.  (Applause.)  They still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable., You know, when Hillary made that speech, she said, “deplorable.”  I thought it was bad, but I didn’t know it was going to be that bad.  (Laughter.)  But the problem is, she said so many of my people were deplorable.  And, you know, the next day, I made a speech, and everybody is wearing, “I am deplorable.”  And I said, “There’s something going on here.”  That was not a good word to use.  You have to be careful in politics, right?  That was not a good — and I would say her last statement about women — they have to get approval from their husbands, their sons, and their male bosses to vote for Trump.  That was not a good statement.  (Laughter and applause).  Not good., You notice how fast the Democrats have run from these statements now?  They are disavowing those statements like I’ve never heard before.  “She’s wrong.”  People that were her biggest supporters are now saying, “What is she doing?”  Why doesn’t she just go home?  (Laughter.)   But that was not a good statement., But we know the truth.  And the truth is that we are great patriots.  We really are.  We’re doing what’s right.  We come from every city, from every town, from every walk of life.  We come from backgrounds, and it doesn’t matter the color, the creed.  But we all have one thing in common: We love this country.  We love this country.  (Applause.)  And we’re putting the interests of our country and our people and our taxpayers — we’re putting them first.  This election is not merely about which party is in charge in Congress.  It’s about whether the American people will be in charge of their government., The choice cannot be any clearer.  It’s never been this clear.  It’s never — think of it.  It’s never been this clear.  The Democrats used to be somewhat in the middle, and now they’re so far right — meaning, that’s where they’re going to be.  But the Democrats used to be right here.  And now what happened is they just moved.  They just moved.  They’re going so far to the left-hand side of the equation, I don’t know whether or not it’s going to even be possible for them to do well.  But for some reason, they’ll probably do okay.  We can’t let that happen.  They have gone so far left, we have to go a little bit further right.  We’re doing very, very well, and I think you’re going to have something very, very, special take place in a short period of time.  (Applause.), While congressional Democrats delay, and they obstruct, and they resist, Republicans actually deliver.  There’s never been a group that have delivered like we’ve delivered, especially in the first year of an administration.  We’re creating jobs for everybody — for the African American population.  They’re thanking me.  They’re thanking me.  Hispanic Americans, all Americans.  But they’re really thanking us., While Democrats denigrate our history, Republicans believe young Americans should be taught to have pride in America’s achievements and to treasure our truly incredible heritage.  While Democrats hand over our rights to international organizations, we defend our sovereignty and we defend our Constitution.  And we defend our American flag.  We’re the ones defending it.  (Applause.), And while Democrats sit on their hands, Republicans stand with law enforcement.  (Applause.)  These are great people.  We stand with working families.  And we always proudly stand for our national anthem.  (Applause.), We believe in strong borders and safe communities.  And we believe in the truth of our national motto: In God we trust.  (Applause.), Our victories are Americans’ victories because the Republican Party is now the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American Dream.  (Applause.), Our mission is to serve the needs, the desires, and the highest ambitions of the American people.  And that’s what we’re doing.  And we’re really doing a great job of it.  We work for them.  Their hopes are our hopes.  Their dreams are our dreams.  And their future if what we are fighting for each and every day., With your help, and with our Republican majorities in Congress, we will carry the hopes and dreams of the American people all the way to victory in November.  So important.  So important.  And together, we will build a future of safety, security, prosperity, and freedom for all of our citizens.  We will never give in.  We will never give up.  And we will never, ever stop fighting to make America great again.  And that’s what’s happening.  (Applause.), ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill, \\nWashington, D.C., 7:00 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome.  And thank you to my friend Frank Donatelli for that overly generous introduction., Frank knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is just a little bit shorter.  I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican — in that order.  (Applause.), And I’s a great honor to be here tonight to address the rising generation of conservative leaders, the men and women of Young America’s Foundation, here at the 39th National Conservative Student Conference.  Give yourselves a round of applause.  You’re going to be making a difference in America for a long time.  (Applause.), So welcome back to Washington, D.C.  Before I get started, I bring greetings this evening from a friend of mine, a man who’s fighting every day for common-sense, conservative values — from the very heart of the White House in the Oval Office, I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America — President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), Thanks to the support of so many young conservatives like all of you here today all across this country, last November President Trump won a historic victory.  More counties than any President since Ronald Reagan — 30 of 50 states, states no Republican had carried in a generation.  The truth is with your support, President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red.  (Applause.), And I came here tonight just to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped elect a President who is fighting every day, fighting every day for the values and the ideals that unite us, and fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the American people., And for my part, it’s a privilege to be back at the Young America’s Foundation.  I’ve worked hand-in-hand with YAF going back more than 15 years — not from when that picture was taken.  (Laughter.)  But from when I first arrived in Congress in 2001.  In 2005, my family had the great privilege to visit the Reagan Ranch, where YAF has wonderfully preserved the wisdom and legacy of my second favorite President of the United States, President Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.), I have to tell you as I ran into Ron and Frank backstage, thinking of all the years that we’ve stood together and all the encouragement they’ve been to me as a conservative, I just can’t tell you how genuinely humbling it is for me to think that I’m standing before you today because of their encouragement, and support and because of folks like you all over this country, and because of the confidence and generosity of our new President that I stand before you today as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America.  So on behalf of my family, thank you for the opportunity to serve.  (Applause.), It’s remarkable to think about the Young America’s Foundation’s history and contributions not just to my small life but to the conservative movement itself and to this entire country., Since its founding in 1960, YAF has been a bulwark of American greatness.  You fight for the truths of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  You fight for those timeless principles of “individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional moral values”.  And let there be no doubt because of the work of all of you all across this country, conservative values are winning on campuses and winning the hearts and minds of America one student at a time.  (Applause.), Today, YAF has more than 300 chapters that are active on over 2,000 campuses all across the United States, reaching a stunning 400,000 students every year., You run so many noteworthy projects and programs, but I’d especially like to thank you particularly for your heroic work promoting and standing for freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas on the campuses across this country.  (Applause.), As I said in an address I gave at the University of Notre Dame just a few months ago, we live in a time when free speech and civility are waning on campuses across America, but YAF is committed to change that.  And you’re making a great difference., You’ve speaking out against speech codes, safe spaces, political correctness.  You fight to defend conservative speakers and students who want nothing more than to exercise their First Amendment right to the freedom of speech., And so tonight, I just want to say thank you.  Thank you to the young men and women of Young America’s Foundation for your strong stand for our freedoms, and thank you for all that you do, day-in and day-out to bring the conservative message to the public square.  (Applause.), And I can promise you as you labor, I see it every day, the Young America’s Foundation finally has a friend back in the Oval Office in the White House.  (Applause.), President Donald Trump has been fighting every day for the conservative vision, the conservative values that you and I hold dear., President Trump has given voice I believe to the aspirations and frustrations of the American people like no leader since President Ronald Reagan., And our President has gone right to work putting men and women into a Cabinet and into this administration that have been advancing that agenda with consistency and with courage., I got to tell you I think President Donald Trump has assembled the strongest conservative Cabinet in my lifetime — bar none.  (Applause.)  Think about it.  How about Ambassador Nikki Haley to the United Nations?  (Applause.)  How about Dr. Ben Carson at Housing and Urban Development?  (Applause.)  In fact, I know you’re going to hear from Dr. Carson tonight, and he’s just an incredible member of this Cabinet — right along with others like Secretary of Defense Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis.  (Applause.), You go around that table and people like Betsy DeVos and others, truly it speaks volumes about this President’s commitment to surrounding himself with extraordinary men and women as a part of this administration’s team, and I couldn’t be more proud to be a small part of it., So as I stand before you today, I’m deeply humbled to be able to report to you that not just in assembling this team, but since day one of this administration, this President has been putting conservative principles into practice to strengthen America at home and abroad so that your generation can live in a country that is prosperous, safe, and free and is built on the highest ideals of the American experience.  (Applause.), Just look at what our President has done to get the American economy moving again already.  President Trump I’m pleased to report has actually signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history.  (Applause.)  This President has been unleashing American energy after years of frustration by a liberal administration like when he authorized the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines.  (Applause.)  And begun to roll back the Clean Power Plan.  The truth is under President Donald Trump, the war on coal is over.  (Applause.), And this President has been putting America first, like when he announced that the United States of America officially today notified the United Nations that we are withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.  (Applause.), In a word, President Trump been keeping his promise to make America prosperous again.  Just this morning, the news came in — did you hear about it?  Over 1 million new jobs have been created across this country by businesses large and small since President Donald Trump took office.  More Americans working than ever before, and unemployment hasn’t been this low in 16 years.  And as the President tweeted this morning, we “have only just begun”!  (Applause.), But as important as our prosperity is, this President knows that security is the foundation of our prosperity.  And serving with him every day, I can assure you, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people., Our President has travelled across the wider world, reaffirming our historic alliances, challenging all who cherish freedom to step up and confront the forces that threaten our way of life.  President Trump I’m pleased to report — once again, we have a President who stands without apology on the world stage as leader of the free world.  (Applause.), And I have to tell you more personal to me, as the proud father of a United States Marine, I couldn’t be more grateful to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, their families, and our veterans.  (Applause.), The United States of America simply has the finest armed forces in the history of the world.  The men and women who wear the uniform of this country are the best of your generation, and I’m inspired whenever I’m among them.  Today, at Dover Air Force Base two heroes of this generation came home.  Sergeant Jonathon Hunter and Specialist Christopher Harris of the 82nd Airborne.  These two heroes fell defending our freedom in Afghanistan this week.  We honor their service and their sacrifice.  Their names will be enshrined in the hearts of a grateful nation, and their families and their loved ones will remain our prayers.  For no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.  These two men were heroes.  We honor them tonight by standing with all those who at this very hour stand a far distant post on the ramparts of freedom.  God bless them all.  (Applause.), And we honor them through our tributes, but we also honor them through our actions.  And I’ll make you a promise:  President Donald Trump is going to be the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States will have ever had in the White House.  (Applause.), You think about it, our President has already signed the largest increase in military spending in nearly 10 years.  And he’s called on the Congress to pass one of the biggest investments in our defense spending since the days of the Cold War., And under President Donald Trump, I’ll make you a promise:  We’re going to rebuild our military, we’re going to restore the arsenal of democracy, and we are once again going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe.  (Applause.), With the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief, I’m proud to report our armed forces are taking the fight to our enemy on our terms, on their soil.  And with President Donald Trump and our brave warriors in the field in Iraq and in Syrian, we will not rest, we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source, so it can no longer threaten our homeland or threaten our allies around the world.  (Applause.), And when it comes to security at home, our President has been busy as well — securing our borders, enforcing our laws, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our streets, gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminal gangs like MS-13.  And I’m pleased to report under President Donald Trump’s leadership and the efforts of our Homeland Security, illegal immigrant crossings on our southern border are down more than 60 percent since the first day of 2017.  (Applause.), So President Trump is keeping his promise to make America safe again, and I couldn’t be more grateful to serve with him., But frankly, let me say from my heart how meaningful it is to me to serve with a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of life.  (Applause.), In one of his very first acts in office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy to keep taxpayer funding out of organizations that perform and promote abortions abroad, and our President has expanded that policy to cover nearly $9 billion in foreign aid.  (Applause.), And President Trump has empowered states to withhold federal funding from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, and I’m humbled to say that at the President’s direction, I was able to cast the tie-breaking vote in Senate to allow states to defund Planned Parenthood.  (Applause.), So this President has been standing for the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.  And he’s been making sure that his appointments to courts of this land will adhere to the Constitution as it’s written, to strictly construe the Constitution.  The men and women that we’re putting forward to fill our federal benches are going to be people that uphold our highest traditions, like the newest member of Supreme Court of the United States — Justice Neil Gorsuch.   (Applause.), So it’s about jobs and prosperity.  It’s about security at home and abroad.  It’s our fundamental liberties, and it’s strengthening America each and every day.  President Trump has done all that and more, and it’s been only a little more than six months., But as the President likes to say, at this White House, that’s just what we call a good start.  (Applause.), The truth is we got a lot more work to do.  My fellow conservatives, let me assure you:  Job one for this administration going forward is we’re going to fight every day to keep the promise we made, and we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  (Applause.), Last week, it was clear that the Senate wasn’t quite ready to keep that promise to the American people, when they fell one vote short of moving forward on a bill to repeal and replace this disastrous policy., The truth is every day Obamacare survives is another day the American people struggle.  When Obamacare passed, we heard a lot of promises.  You remember?  We heard if you like your doctor, you can keep it — not true.  We heard if you like your health insurance, can you keep it — not true.  We heard that the cost of health insurance was going to go down.  That one sure wasn’t true.  In fact, we were promised that families would save up to $2,500 in health insurance premiums if this thing became law about seven years ago.  And the truth is the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than a plan did in 2013., And while premiums are soaring, choices are plummeting.  Next year, at least 40 percent of American counties, including nine whole states, will have only one choice of a health insurance provider, meaning they’ll essentially have no choice at all., Even worse, many counties will have no health insurance providers whatsoever in 2018 all across this country.  And it’s not just about the statistics.  It’s about real people.  It’s about small business owners, family farmers all across this country that are struggling to make ends meet., Behind every number is a name, behind every name is a story.  And I’ve heard these stories as I’ve traveled across America, and so has the President.  Small businesses that talk about the heartache of struggling to keep their whole workforce in place, people that have worked for them for years and years.  But with skyrocketing costs of health insurance, they got to choose between keeping the business going and keeping people on the payroll that they’ve known for years and years., I’ve talked to working families — literally a woman in Wisconsin told me that she had to take a pass on paying her health insurance premium for three months just so she’d have enough money to buy Christmas presents for her grandkids., We all know the truth, America knows the truth:  Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go.  (Applause.), Now, the President and I were disappointed when the Senate came up short in finishing what the House of Representatives had started.  In fact, the President said, every single one of those Democrats in the Senate and just a couple — handful of Republicans in his words “let the American people down”.  And that’s the truth of it., But my fellow conservatives, let me be clear:  This ain’t over, this ain’t by a long shot.  (Applause.), And President Trump — are absolutely committed to keep our promise to the American people.  We were not elected to save Obamacare; we were elected to repeal and replace it.  And you can know with confidence that President Donald Trump and I are going to fight every day until we end the Obamacare nightmare once and for all.  (Applause.), And when that day comes — and rest assured, it will come — we will begin to restore a healthcare system based on those timeless American principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform.  That’s the conservative way to meet the needs of this country in the 21st century when it comes to healthcare, and that is the American way to improve 21st century healthcare for this generation and the next.  (Applause.), And while we’re working with this Congress to act on healthcare, I’ll make you another promise:  President Donald Trump and I are going to roll our sleeves up, sit down with lawmakers, and we’re going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.)  We’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms., And President Trump is going cut business taxes in America so American companies can compete with companies around the world to create good-paying jobs right here in gold old USA.  (Applause.), So it’s about healthcare.  It’s about tax cuts.  And under this President’s leadership, and with the support of this Congress, we’re going to keep rolling forward.  We’ll make those historic investments in national defense to make America stronger and safer than ever before., We’ll keep reining in those unelected bureaucrats so they can’t cripple our economy from the comfort of those taxpayer-funded metal desks., We’ll enact real education reform to give families more choices and make it possible for every child to be able to go to the school of their choice and have access to the world-class education every child deserves.  It’s a lot of work to do., But I know I’m looking at a lot of young people that are anxious to get to it.  So to this rising generation of conservative leaders, I’ll tell you — you picked a great time to show up.  (Applause.) Because this the moment, now is the time., To finish what we’ve started, though, the President and I are counting on all of you.  We’re counting on this rising generation.  We need your voices.  We need your values.  We need your energy and your vision as never before., As this rising generation of American leaders, you know that your future, the future of this country depends on what we do in the days ahead.  No one has more stake in it than you., It was President Reagan who memorably said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,” and this rings just as true today as it did a half century ago when he said it., So I came here to night really to encourage you to keep standing up.  Keep speaking out. Let your voices heard.  With your peers and your colleagues, go out there and keep advocating without apology and with cheerfulness the common-sense conservative message that this country longs to hear., And from this day forward, the President and I are going to have to count on every ounce of your energy.  Your enthusiasm, your courage, your conviction, and your passion.  And I know we’ll have it., But there’s one more thing I might ask of you if you’re so inclined.  This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation — widening and unknowable threats around the world, too much division here at home, an economy that’s now beginning to get on its feet after years of struggling under the weight of big government.  And I would just say as you leave here from this great conference energized, hearing all these speakers that you heard this week, you go back to your homes and go back to your schools renewed in your determination to make a difference for conservative values, I’d encourage you if you’re inclined to bow the head and bend the knee, it would be a good time to do that, too., The truth is it’s a good time to pray for America because America matters far beyond our shores., And when I tell you to pray for America, I’m not so much talking about an agenda or a party, but really just pray for this country.  Abraham Lincoln I thought had it pretty right.  He was asked in his time if he thought God was on his side, and he said, I’d rather concern myself more with whether we’re on God’s side than whether God is our side., So just pray for this country.  Pray for all who serve her in every capacity because I truly do believe those ancient words of millennia ago are as true today as they’ve ever been, words that Americans have clung to in much more challenging times than these, that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, he’ll hear from Heaven, and he’ll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  (Applause.), AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So in a word, men and women of the Young America’s Foundation, have faith.  Have faith in the principles that you hold in your hearts that brought you to this place today.  Have faith in each other, and in your fellow conservatives, the ability to make a difference as conservatives have ever since this movement was born.  Have faith in this President, who I promise you and the whole team is fighting for you every.  And above all else, have a boundless faith in the American people, and in Him who placed this miracle of democracy on this wilderness shores, that He will still do as He’s always done, He will bless America., And so I say to this rising generation, with your support, with the leadership that we have in President Donald Trump and in our majorities in the House and Senate and all across this land, and with all of your shining faces, I’m confident, together, we will make America safe again.  Together, we will make America prosperous again.  And together, to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again., Thank you very much.  God bless the Young America’s Foundation and God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.), END, \\n7:28 P.M.

       "      <td>[Rose Garden, 3:32 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.  We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.  But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected., \\nBefore we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.  The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.  We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs., I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.  It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you., In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.  We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.  Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution., One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.  And believe me, we’ve just begun.  The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so., On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments.  And I don’t want anything to get in our way.  I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.  Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — (applause) — thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.  So we’re getting out.  But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.  And if we can, that’s great.  And if we can’t, that’s fine.  (Applause.), As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.  The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production., Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.  This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune., Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.  This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.  They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little., According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.  The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that., Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.  As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters., For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.  They can do whatever they want for 13 years.  Not us.  India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.  There are many other examples.  But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States., Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.  We’re having a big opening in two weeks.  Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.  A big opening of a brand-new mine.  It’s unheard of.  For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.  They asked me if I’d go.  I’m going to try., China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.  So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.  India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  Think of it:  India can double their coal production.  We’re supposed to get rid of ours.  Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants., In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries., \\nThis agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.  The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.  A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.  We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world., We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.  Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness., The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.  At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country — (applause) — will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life., Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.  Tiny, tiny amount.  In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes., As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  “The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate.”  The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.  We’ll be the cleanest.  We’re going to have the cleanest air.  We’re going to have the cleanest water.  We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.  We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.  (Applause.), And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.  One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years., I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.  (Applause.), So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.  We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.  And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.  And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.  And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.  But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement., I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world., No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.  The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.  That’s not going to happen while I’m President.  I’m sorry.  (Applause.), My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection., \\nOur tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well.  I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.  The Republicans are working very, very hard.  We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.  But it’s going very well., The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.  They don’t put America first.  I do, and I always will.  (Applause.), The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.  You see what’s happening.  It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind., At what point does America get demeaned?  At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?   We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.  We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.  And they won’t be.  They won’t be., I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.  (Applause.)  I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.  Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.  Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.  The process has begun from day one.  But now we’re down to business., Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.  So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.  Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime., The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.  That’s where they came.  Believe me, they didn’t come from me.  They came just before I came into office.  Not good.  And not good the way they took the money., In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as “peanuts,” and stated that “the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.”  In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.  And nobody even knows where the money is going to.  Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?, Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.  America is $20 trillion in debt.  Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.  Millions of our citizens are out of work.  And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.  So think of that., There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.  Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.  Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.  (Applause.)  Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.  And I will., Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.  It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal., The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.  In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point.  And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.  Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in., As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.  The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.  It is time to exit the Paris Accord — (applause) — and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country., It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France.  It is time to make America great again.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much., Thank you very much.  Very important.  I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words., Scott, please.  (Applause.), ADMINISTRATOR PRUITT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Your decision today to exit the Paris Accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first., And by exiting, you’re fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people.  Please know that I am thankful for your fortitude, your courage, and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country., America finally has a leader who answers only to the people — not to the special interests who have had their way for way too long.  In everything you do, Mr. President, you’re fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country.  You’re a champion for the hardworking citizens all across this land who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interest., You have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you’ve done that in any number of ways — from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, D.C.  And today you’ve put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment., This is an historic restoration of American economic independence — one that will benefit the working class, the working poor, and working people of all stripes.  With this action, you have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again.  And it should be noted that we as a nation do it better than anyone in the world in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment., We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.  After all, before the Paris Accord was ever signed, America had reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s.  In fact, between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18-plus percent.  And this was accomplished not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of the American private sector., For that reason, Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of world does little.  Other nations talk a good game; we lead with action — not words.  (Applause.), Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint to learn from us.  That should be our focus versus agreeing to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people., Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what’s right by the American people.  You have that courage, and the American people can take comfort because you have their backs., Thank you, Mr. President., END, \\n4:03 P.M.

He’s been a friend for many years. And, ladies and gentleman, how about that governor, Rick Scott? (Applause.), Florida is incredibly fortunate to have a leader like Rick Scott. Since he took office, he’s signed over 50 tax cuts, he balanced the budget year after year, and he helped create more than 1.3 million jobs — one of the fastest-growing state economies in America. (Applause.) The sun is definitely shining on Florida State with Governor Rick Scott. Give him another round of applause, would you please? (Applause.), Governor, I have to tell you, President Trump and I are proud — proud to partner with you to make America great again. (Applause.) The same goes with all the other dedicated public servants who are here with us today. And I’m honored to be in their presence. Congressman John Rutherford, Mayor Lenny Curry — thank you for joining us., And, Seema Verma, it is such a privilege to have you here. Folks, I had the honor of swearing her in this past Tuesday as the 15th Administrator of America’s Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. She happens to be a Hoosier, and she’s one of the leading healthcare experts in the country, and she’s going to do an incredible job for people all across this country. (Applause.) Thank all these public servants. (Applause.) I can say with confidence Seema Verma is going to help us make American healthcare great again. And I want to thank you so much for your service, Seema. More than I can tell you, I’m incredibly proud., Now, it is a great privilege to be with all of you today, back in this great Sunshine State. Last fall, thanks to all of you — thanks to your hard work, your support, and your prayers — the people of Florida voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America. (Applause.) Florida made a difference. And the President asked me to stop by just to give his personal thanks to each and every one of you. Hardworking Americans like all of you were our biggest supporters., And on behalf of the President and his family, and on behalf of my little family: Thank you, Florida. Your votes have set us on a path to make America great again. And we’re here to say thanks. (Applause.), It was quite a campaign, wasn’t it? And it’s already been quite an administration. (Laughter.) It’s the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. He’s my friend. He’s a man who loves his family, he loves this country — boundless energy and optimism, broad shoulders and a big heart. And thanks I want to express on his behalf, as well., To all the great business owners who are with us today, we enjoyed a great conversation today about the issue that I’ll talk more about in just a moment. And join me in thanking these great job-creators in Jacksonville. Thank you for sharing your candid feedback about what we can do to help you grow jobs right here in Jacksonville. Give them all a word of thanks. (Applause.), Last but not least, I want to thank Mac McGehee and the whole Mac Paper team for hosting us here today. Mac, your family now for three generations have been a pillar in the Jacksonville community for over 50 years, and today you have over 600 employees spread across nine states. You only get that way when you’re doing something right and you’re doing it for a long time. The President and I thank you for all that you do. And let’s give the whole Mac Paper team a big round of applause for their great, great success and the jobs they’ve created here. (Applause.) Thank you., And let me assure you, let me assure all the job-creators, all the people that work for businesses large and small: President Trump, I can assure you — President Trump is going to be the best friend American small business will ever have. (Applause.), You know, I grew up in a small business — a small business family — actually in a small town in southern Indiana. It was a gas station business. I was a — I started working as a gas station attendant in one of my father’s gas stations when I was only 14 years of age. And for you young people in the room, we’ll explain later what a gas station attendant actually used to do. (Laughter.) As the whole world knows, the President also grew up in a family business, too., We actually both know, because of our life experiences in our families, we know the sacrifices that are required to make a business work. And more importantly, we know that when small business is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And President Trump is going to fight for small business America, just as he’s done from day one., We want to create jobs and prosperity and growth in America like never before. And small business is going to be the lion’s share of that. Just look at what the President has already done., On day one, President Trump went straight to work rolling back reams of red tape. He’s instructed literally every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new federal red tape on job-creators in America. (Applause.), He’s taken decisive action already to protect American jobs and American workers by ending illegal immigration once and for all. (Applause.), He also took action recently when he authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines that will create thousands of jobs and protect America’s energy future. (Applause.), And businesses are already responding to President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” vision with optimism and investment. From coast to coast — Governor Scott will back me up on this — companies are announcing that they’re keeping jobs here, they’re creating new jobs — tens of thousands of them. Just last month, the American economy added 235,000 new jobs, and we are just getting started. (Applause.), Under President Trump’s leadership and working with great congressmen like your congressman, John Rutherford, we’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We’re going to keep slashing through red tape, we’re going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can’t cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C. (Applause.), And because you hired a builder to be President of the United States, we’re going to rebuild this country so that Florida and every other state has the resources to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, the best airports, and the best future we could ever imagine, with the infrastructure that we need. (Applause.), But making America great again doesn’t just mean our economy. President Trump has no higher priority, I can assure you, than the safety and security of the American people. Over the past year, the American people watched in horror as terror struck Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale. Our support and our prayers have been with you ever since. And so, for that matter, I can assure you, is our resolve., Rest assured, President Trump will continue to take steps every single day to protect our nation, protect our way of life, and protect and prevent attacks by radical Islamic terrorism in this country again. (Applause.), Your former sheriff knows in his heart what people also know: President Donald Trump is standing with the men and women who serve in law enforcement in this country as never before. (Applause.), Some of you are sitting, a lot of you are standing, but would you all mind getting on your feet and thanking all the men and women in law enforcement who are here with us today? (Applause.) I promise you, under President Trump’s leadership, we’re going to make sure that the men and women who serve in law enforcement have the resources and the training and the tools that they need to protect our families and go home safe to theirs., The President has also taken steps to secure our nation, to secure our borders — which means building a wall, enforcing our laws, beginning with ensuring, as the President said before Congress, that gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities are off the streets of Florida and out of this country. (Applause.), And while we talk about security, this last Thursday President Trump unveiled his budget. It’s a budget that, at its very heart, will end the era of budget cuts for our armed forces. We will rebuild our military. We will restore the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) We will give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. That I promise you. (Applause.), And, lastly, by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch, who will go before the Congress this coming week, President Trump has kept his word to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court of the United States who will keep faith with the Constitution and uphold the God-given liberties that have been enshrined there for now more than two centuries. (Applause.), So we’ve been busy. We’ve been busy. My friends, President Trump is a man of his word, and he’s a man of action. And I believe he will make America great again. And make no mistake, about it: The Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.), It’s amazing — really amazing to think about it. Virtually every promise they made about Obamacare, when it was passed into law, has been broken. We all remember what they were. Remember? They told us the cost of health insurance would go down. Not true. They told us if you liked your doctors, you could keep them. Not true. They told us if you liked your health plan, you could keep it. Not true., Just the other day, I joined President Trump to listen to hardworking Americans who have suffered from these broken promises. They told us in visceral and in emotional terms the stories that I heard from business leaders today: skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer choices, higher taxes. They told us, just like these employers did today, about the hard choices that they’ve had to make, about how Obamacare is standing in the way of not only their companies’ aspirations, but the hopes and dreams of the people that work there and desire to work there. It was a heartbreaking conversation, then and now. And they’re not alone., Think about it: Just last year, premiums, following Obamacare, spiked by 25 percent on average across America. Millions have lost their plans. In one-third of the nation’s counties, Americans only have one insurance company to choose from — which essentially means they have no choice at all. Given all the failings, it’s no wonder that 400,000 fewer people enrolled in Obamacare this year., Now, your governor, I can tell you, has been remarkable on this. He mentioned just a few moments ago — we actually met when, as a private citizen, Rick Scott was fighting against Obamacare before it ever became law. (Applause.) And, Rick, let me thank you for that, and thank you for your ongoing leadership., As Governor Rick Scott said recently — and he knew this from the fight we fought then and the fight you fought every day since — that Obamacare was, in his words, “sold on a lie.” And then, in his typical plain-spoken way, Governor Scott said, it just plain “doesn’t work.” And he was right., Florida is actually a textbook example of everything that’s wrong with Obamacare. Here in the Sunshine State, Obamacare premiums rose by 19 percent last year — with some increasing by nearly 40 percent. Over 400,000 Floridians were scheduled to lose their plans at the start of this year. And nearly three-quarters — 75 percent — of the state has no choice at all when it comes to health insurance., The truth is, Florida can’t afford Obamacare anymore. And job-creators in Florida can’t afford it either. (Applause.) I heard it. I heard it earlier today. The small businesses represented here, they told me that Obamacare hits them with mandates, with regulations, with higher taxes and higher costs., Mac Paper is actually a great case in point. Since Obamacare went into effect, Mac was telling me that they’ve been forced to spend more than $300,000 not on jobs, not on investments that will create more jobs, but on just trying to comply with this failed law., That’s just not right. That money would have been better invested in your workers, Mac. And I know that’s where you would have liked to invest it — in payroll and in benefits, in your future, instead of being wasted on the failed policies of Obamacare., Men and women, this can’t continue. Every day that Obamacare survives is another day the American people and American businesses are struggling. Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.), Since the day Florida helped send President Trump to the White House, I can promise you he has been focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare with something that actually works., We know that the core flaw of Obamacare was this notion that you could order every American to buy health insurance whether they wanted it or needed it or not. That was never the answer., Just a few days ago in Nashville, President Trump actually called that Obamacare’s “fatal flaw.” The President couldn’t be more right. That’s why we’re going to end this flaw. We’re going to replace it with real solutions built on freedom, personal responsibility, and state flexibility and reform. That’s what works, and that’s what President Trump’s plan for healthcare reform will do for the American people. (Applause.), We’re going to begin, though, by repealing Obamacare’s taxes. We’re going to end its mandates by eliminating the penalties. We’re going to give Americans more choices. We’re going to expand health savings accounts for every American. We’re going to give Americans a tax credit that’ll help them buy the coverage they need at a price they can afford. And we’re also going to do it with what the President likes to call “big heart.” We’re going to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions still have access to the coverage that they need. And to you fellow parents out there with kids under the age of 26 — I have three — (laughter) — we’ll make sure you can keep your kids on your insurance until they’re 26 years of age. (Applause.), Now, folks, what I just laid out is only a small glimpse of everything our plan will do. The bill moving through the Congress, the American Health Care Act, is an important step in the right direction. We’re working around the clock with Congressman Rutherford and other members of the Republican majority in the House and the Senate; and with leaders here in Florida to make this bill even better., President Trump laid out a few key elements just yesterday with members of Congress in the Oval Office, and we’re going to continue to work with members of Congress to improve this bill. It’s what the legislative process is all about., And we’re not going to — we’re going to do a couple of different things with a few recent amendments that are worth mentioning and are owing in part to the engagement that we had with Congress., First off, we’re going to stop any more states from expanding Medicaid and adding a burden to future generations. We’re going to give states the option of block grants of Medicaid to the states so states like Florida can innovate and design Medicaid around the unique needs of the people in this community., And we’re going to allow states like Florida to include a work requirement for able-bodied adults ensuring that Medicaid’s benefits are available for those who need it the most. (Applause.), These are all common-sense solutions added to this legislation in a vigorous debate on Capitol Hill, and under the President’s leadership, we’ll continue to listen intently for ways to make this even better., Just yesterday, President Trump made it clear he supports the bill 100 percent, and we all do. Every day, more and more members of Congress are getting on board. And as we work to pass this first bill, rest assured our administration is also working with Dr. Tom Price over at Health and Human Services and with Seema Verma at the Center for Medicaid Services to give states like Florida the freedom and flexibility to help your most vulnerable in the ways that are going to be best for you., Just this past week, they sent a letter to Governor Scott and other state leaders around the country saying that “a new era for the federal and state Medicaid partnership” has begun — and so it is. (Applause.), The fact is, and I say this as a governor of the state of Indiana, that the fact is Florida is a unique state with unique needs — and this administration knows that state-based solutions, designed by your governor, your state legislature are the best way to give better coverage, and get better healthcare outcomes, particularly for the most vulnerable citizens across the state of Florida., And under President Trump’s leadership lastly just know this, we’re going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines — the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. (Applause.), That’s the combination. President Trump and I know that the way to lower costs is to increase choices to create a dynamic national marketplace, and that’s what our plan will do. Probably won’t be too long before you see Flo and some little lizard on television — (laughter) — selling health insurance. And that’s the American way., And let me say a couple of things to you before I slip off and get on that plane and head back south with your governor. I want to assure the people of Florida: We’re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America that makes affordable, high-quality health insurance accessible for every American. (Applause.), But be assured about this, be clear on this, though, folks, this is going to be a battle in Washington, D.C. All right? Obamacare’s defenders are working hard, so we have to work harder. And we’re counting on Florida. We need every Republican in Florida to support this bill and support the President’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare., AUDIENCE MEMBER: That’s why we voted., THE VICE PRESIDENT: And President Trump and I — President Trump and I are confident — we’re confident that with your support, Florida will be there, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all. (Applause.), It really is remarkable this time we find ourselves in, a time of renewed hope and boundless opportunity for the American people. I think we’re at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history that started last November the 8th., In this moment, though, I want to leave you with a challenge, we need every freedom-loving American who knew we could be stronger, who knew we could be better, who knew we could stand tall again to yourselves stand up and speak out. It’s time that we demanded government as good as our people. We need you to tell the world that we can do better, that we’re renewing and restoring this country, that we’re putting it back on a path to a brighter future. Tell your neighbors and your friends. Stop people outside the drug store. Just let them know how strongly you support the President’s vision for this country, particularly when it comes to healthcare., One of my favorite verses in the Old Book is from the Book of Jeremiah. It’s hung over the mantle of our home since I first ran for Congress successfully in the year 2000, and now it hangs over the mantle in the Vice President’s Residence in Washington, D.C., It simply reads: “For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.”, In November, I believe with all of my heart that the people of Florida and the people of this country voted to give America a President with the strength, the courage, and the vision, to make America safe again. You voted to give us a new leader who will make America prosperous again. And I know in my heart with your continued faith and support, together we will make America great again., Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. God bless you and God bless America.

       "      <td>[ , East Room, 2:26 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Melania, for your moving words and for your devotion — it’s a very deep devotion, I can tell you that — to our nation and its children., Thank you also to members of Congress, my Cabinet, governors, members of Congress, state, local leaders, first responders, and healthcare professionals gathered here today.  We have some truly incredible people in this room — that I can tell you., Most importantly, we acknowledge the families present who have lost a cherished loved one.  As you all know from personal experience, families, communities, and citizens across our country are currently dealing with the worst drug crisis in American history and even, if you really think about it, world history.  This is all throughout the world.  The fact is this is a worldwide problem., This crisis of drug use, addiction, and overdose deaths in many years, it’s just been so long in the making.  Addressing it will require all of our effort and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its very real complexity., Last year, we lost at least 64,000 Americans to overdoses.  That’s 175 lost American lives per day.  That’s seven lost lives per hour in our country.  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States by far., More people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined.  Think of it — motor vehicle crashes, gun homicides, more people by far from drug overdoses., These overdoses are driven by a massive increase in addiction to prescription painkillers, heroin, and other opioids.  Last year, almost 1 million Americans used heroin, and more than 11 million abused prescription opioids.  The United States is by far the largest consumer of these drugs, using more opioid pills per person than any other country by far in the world.  Opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999 and now account for the majority of fatal drug overdoses.  Who would have thought?, No part of our society — not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural — has been spared this plague of drug addiction and this horrible, horrible situation that’s taken place with opioids., In West Virginia — a truly great state, great people — there is a hospital nursery where one in every five babies spends its first days in agony.  Because these precious babies were exposed to opioids or other drugs in the womb, they endure nausea, pain, anxiety, sleeplessness, and trouble eating, just the same as adults undergoing detox., Some of these children will likely lose one or both of their parents to drug addiction and overdose.  They will join the growing ranks of America’s opioid orphans.  Such beautiful, beautiful babies., Beyond the shocking death toll, the terrible measure of the opioid crisis includes the families ripped apart and, for many communities, a generation of lost potential and opportunity., This epidemic is a national health emergency, unlike many of us we’ve seen and what we’ve seen in our lifetimes.  Nobody has seen anything like what’s going on now., As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.  Never been this way.  We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.  We can do it.  (Applause.)  We can do it., That is why, effective today, my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law, and why I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis.  This marks a critical step in confronting the extraordinary challenge that we face., As part of this emergency response, we will announce a new policy to overcome a restrictive 1970s-era rule that prevents states from providing care at certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds for those suffering from drug addiction.  (Applause.), A number of states have reached out to us asking for relief, and you should expect to see approvals that will unlock treatment for people in need.  And those approvals will come very, very fast.  Not like in the past — very, very quickly., Ending the epidemic will require mobilization of government, local communities, and private organizations.  It will require the resolve of our entire country., The scale of this crisis of addiction is why, soon after coming into office, I convened a presidential commission, headed by Governor Chris Christie, that has consulted with experts across America to listen, to learn, and report back on potential solutions., We await the final report, which will come in next week.  And I know some of the report has already been seen, because I want to see it as quickly as possible.  And some of the things that they are recommending are common sense, but very, very important.  And they’re going to have a tremendous impact, believe me — tremendous impact., Today, I will detail many of these aggressive steps with my administration, which we’ve already taken.  After we review and evaluate the commission’s findings, I will quickly move to implement approximate and appropriate recommendations., But I want the American people to know:  The federal government is aggressively fighting the opioid epidemic on all fronts.  We’re working with doctors and medical professionals to implement best practices for safe opioid prescribing, and we will do something very, very special.  We are requiring federally employed prescribers to receive, finally, special training., The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a prescription awareness campaign to put faces on the danger of opioid abuse., I want to acknowledge CVS Caremark for announcing last month that it will limit certain first-time opioid prescriptions to seven-day supplies, among other important reforms.  And I encourage other companies to do their part to help to stop this epidemic.  (Applause.), The FDA is now requiring drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids to provide more training to prescribers and to help prevent abuse and addiction, and has requested that one especially high-risk opioid be withdrawn from the market immediately.  We are requiring that a specific opioid, which is truly evil, be taken off the market immediately.  (Applause.), The U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Homeland Security are strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China and 50 times stronger than heroin., And in two weeks, I will be in China with President Xi, and I will mention this as a top priority.  (Applause.)  And he will do something about it., I am also pleased to report that for the first time, the Department of Justice has indicated [indicted] major Chinese drug traffickers for distributing — and they have really put very, very strong clamps on them.  They’ve indicted them, the drug traffickers, for distributing fentanyl in the United States.  So, Jeff, thank you very much.  Good job.  (Applause.), And they’ve been indicted and we’re not going to forget about them, believe me.  They are doing tremendous harm to our country.  The Justice Department is aggressively and, really, valiantly pursuing those who illegally prescribe and traffic in opioids, both in our communities and on the Internet., And I will be looking at the potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad actors.  What they have and what they’re doing to our people is unheard of.  We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that are hurting our people.  And that will start taking place pretty soon.  (Applause.), We’re also supporting first responders’ and medical professionals’ access to the tools they need to prevent deaths through life-saving overdose medications., At my direction, the National Institute of Health, headed up by Francis Collins, has taken the first steps of an ambitious public-private partnership with pharmaceutical companies to develop non-addictive painkillers and new treatments for addiction and overdose.  So important.  (Applause.), I will be pushing the concept of non-addictive painkillers very, very hard.  We have to come up with that solution.  We give away billions and billions of dollars a year, and we’re going to be spending lots of money on coming up with a non-addictive solution., We will be asking Dr. Collins and the NIH for substantial resources in the fight against drug addiction.  One of the things our administration will be doing is a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place because they will see the devastation and the ruination it causes to people and people’s lives., Watch what happens, if we do our jobs, how the number of drug users and the addicted will start to tumble downward over a period of years.  It will be a beautiful thing to see., I learned, myself — I had a brother, Fred — great guy, best-looking guy, best personality — much better than mine.  (Laughter.)  But he had a problem.  He had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, “Don’t drink.  Don’t drink.”  He was substantially older, and I listened to him and I respected, but he would constantly tell me, don’t drink.  He’d also add, don’t smoke.  But he would say it over and over and over again., And to this day, I’ve never had a drink.  And I have no longing for it.  I have no interest in it.  To this day, I’ve never had a cigarette.  Don’t worry, those are only two of my good things.  I don’t want to tell you about the bad things.  (Laughter.)  There’s plenty of bad things too., But he really helped me.  I had somebody that guided me, and he had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol — believe me, very, very tough, tough life.  He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through.  But I learned because of Fred.  I learned., And that’s what I think is so important.  This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs — just not to take them.  When I see friends of mine that are having difficulty with not having that drink at dinner, where it’s literally almost impossible for them to stop, I say to myself, I can’t even understand it — why would that be difficult?  But we understand why it is difficult., The fact is, if we can teach young people — and people, generally — not to start, it’s really, really easy not to take them.  And I think that’s going to end up being our most important thing.  Really tough, really big, really great advertising, so we get to people before they start, so they don’t have to go through the problems of what people are going through.  (Applause.)  Thank you., We are already distributing nearly $1 billion in grants for addiction prevention and treatment, and over $50 million dollars to support law enforcement programs that assist those facing prison and facing addiction., We have also launched an $81 million partnership to research better pain management techniques for our incredible veterans.  And soon — (applause) — and, by the way, Secretary Shulkin is here.  You have done an incredible job for our veterans in a very short period of time.  (Applause.)  And soon, HHS will launch a taskforce to develop and update best practices for pain management across the federal government., I am urging all Americans to help fight this opioid epidemic and the broader issue of drug addiction by participating in the National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day this Saturday.  When you can safely turn in these dangerous and horrible drugs for disposal, that will be a wonderful, wonderful period of time for you., All of these actions are important parts of my administration’s larger effort to confront the drug addiction crisis in America and confront it head on, straight on — strong.  We’re going to do it.  We’re going to do it., For too long, we have allowed drugs to ravage American homes, cities, and towns.  We owe it to our children and our country to do everything in our power to address this national shame and this human tragedy., We must stop the flow of all types of illegal drugs into our communities.  (Applause.)  For too long, dangerous criminal cartels have been allowed to infiltrate and spread throughout our nation.  An astonishing 90 percent of the heroin in America comes from south of the border, where we will be building a wall which will greatly help in this problem.  (Applause.)  It will have a great impact.  My administration is dedicated to enforcing our immigration laws, defending our maritime security, and securing our borders., We also have to work with other countries to stop these drugs where they originate.  We have no choice.  We have to work with others, we have to get together, because they have similar problems to what we have.  Some countries have bigger problems than we have.  Whether that country is China, whether it’s a country in Latin America, it makes no difference.  We’re going to be working with all of them.  We’re taking the fight directly to the criminals in places that they’re producing this poison., Here in America, we are once again enforcing the law; breaking up gangs and distribution networks; and arresting criminals who peddle dangerous drugs to our youth., In addition, we understand the need to confront reality, right smack in the face, that millions of our fellow citizens are already addicted.  That’s the reality.  We want them to get the help they need.  We have no choice but to help these people that are hooked and are suffering so they can recover and rebuild their lives with their families., We’re committed to pursuing innovative approaches that have been proven to work, like drug courts.  Our efforts will be based on sound metrics, and guided by evidence and guided by results.  This includes making addiction treatment available to those in prison and to help them eventually reenter society as productive and law-abiding citizens., Finally, we must adopt the most common-sense solution of all: to prevent our citizens from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place.  (Applause.), We must and are focusing so much of our effort on drug demand reduction.  We must confront the culture of drug abuse head-on to reduce demand for dangerous narcotics.  Every person who buys illicit drugs here in America should know that they are risking their futures, their families, and even their lives.  And every American should know that if they purchase illegal drugs, they are helping to finance some of the most violent, cruel, and ruthless organizations anywhere in the world.  Illegal drug use is not a victimless crime.  There is nothing admirable, positive, or socially desirable about it.  There is nothing desirable about drugs.  They’re bad., We want the next generation of young Americans to know the blessings of a drug-free life.  In this enormous struggle against drug addiction, an opioid epidemic — it really is that; it is an epidemic — our greatest hope is the same as it has always been.  Through every trial America has encountered throughout our history, the spirit of our people and the strength of our character, we win.  Each of us has a responsibility to this effort.  We have a total responsibility to ourselves, to our family, to our country, including those who are struggling with this addiction., Each of us is responsible to look out for our loved ones, our communities, our children, our neighbors, and our own health.  Almost every American has witnessed the horrors of addiction.  Whether it’s through their own struggle or through the struggle of a friend, a coworker, a neighbor or, frankly, a family member, our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better.  But get better it will.  It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency., We are inspired by the stories of everyday heroes who pull their communities from the depths of despair through leadership and through love., Fire Chief Dan Goonan, of New Hampshire — great state — runs a program, Safe Station, which allows drug-dependent residents to seek help at fire stations at any time., Jesse and Cyndi Swafford of Dayton, Ohio have provided a loving, stable home to children affected by the opioid crisis., I am calling on every American to join the ranks of guardian angels like Chief Goonan and the Swaffords, who help lift up the people of our great nation., Together, we will care for our citizens, our children, and our orphans and our — and you know what I’m going to say — our foster youth.  So many.  So many.  But we’re going to lift them up, and we’re going to take care of them.  We will work to strengthen vulnerable families and communities, and we will help to build and grow a stronger, healthier, and drug-free society., Together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need., Working together, we will defeat this opioid epidemic.  It will be defeated.  We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse.  And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America.  We are going to overcome addiction in America., We have fought and won many battles and many wars before, and we will win again., Thank you.  God bless you.  And God Bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.), Thank you.  Here we go.  This is very important:  “Combatting the National Drug Demand and Opioid Crisis.”  Right?  So important.  We will win, right?, (The presidential memorandum is signed.)  (Applause.), END, 2:53 P.M.

       "      <td>[Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, \\nDallas, Texas, 12:55 P.M. CDT, Well, hello NRA!  (Applause.)  Thank you, Chris, for that kind introduction.  Chris knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter.  (Laughter.)  I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.  And I’m a card-carrying member of the NRA.  (Applause.), To Wayne LaPierre, to Governor Abbott, to the distinguished members of Congress, to all my fellow Americans who’ve come from near and far, it is great to be back at the 147th annual meeting of the National Rifle Association.  Thank you all.  (Applause.), And I’m especially proud to be here with a good friend of mine — (laughter) — a great champion of our most cherished liberties, and a man, I can tell you, who can’t wait to get out here: The 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), You know, last year, President Trump spoke to this very gathering; the first President to do so in 34 years.  (Applause.)  And he told you then, in his words, that, “You have a true friend in the White House.”  And I’m here today, as his Vice President, to tell you that you have two friends in the White House.  (Applause.), President Donald Trump and I both stand without apology for the Second Amendment.  And in this administration, the right of the people to keep and bear arms will not be infringed.  (Applause.), That right is truly one of our first and most important freedoms.  Our founders won our independence with the power of their ideas and their muskets.  Our pioneers won the west, and expanded the frontiers of freedom, with their daring, their courage, and their Springfields, Winchesters, and Colts.  (Applause.), From generation to generation, our forebears have fought our nation’s wars and defended our way of life with the skills they learned on the rifle range, or in a dove field, or in a deer stand, or at the knee of a father or grandfather back home., And in our own day, there is no greater champion of America’s tradition of responsible gun ownership than you, the men and women of the National Rifle Association.  (Applause.), The National Rifle Association is an organization forged in freedom.  For nearly 150 years, the NRA has valiantly defended the Constitution and all our God-given liberties., In its early years, the NRA helped train our fellow citizens in gun safety and marksmanship — a tradition that continues even as this organization has gone on to become one of the principal defenders of our Second Amendment rights., Today, more than 5 million Americans are proud members of the NRA.  And the work you do is essential to preserving our freedoms at every level of the American government.  So give yourselves a round of applause for all you do for the ideals we cherish.  (Applause.), And President Trump and I came here today, mostly, just to say, “thanks.”  Thank you for all you do to defend liberty.  And thank you for electing a President and a Congress that are making America great again.  (Applause.), Because of your support, on Election Day and every day since, you can only describe this administration one way: It’s been 15 months of promises made and promises kept.  And we’re just getting started.  (Applause.), I mean, think about it.  President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy.  And just over one month ago, President Trump signed into law the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.), Our President promised to enforce our laws and secure our borders.  We’ve taken on sanctuary cities.  We’re fighting to end catch-and-release and close all the dangerous immigration loopholes in our laws.  The President signed into law the biggest funding increase for border security in nearly a decade and even ordered the National Guard to the southern border.  Under this President’s leadership, we’ve nearly doubled the arrests of vicious gang members in MS-13.  (Applause.)  And thanks to the leadership of President Trump, Congress approved funding for the first 100 miles of a border wall.  (Applause.), And I’ll make you a promise.  When it comes to that big border wall, we’re going to build it all.  (Applause.), This President has also stood for all the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.  And I have tell you, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life.  (Applause.), To protect all our unalienable rights, President Trump promised to appoint strong conservatives to the federal courts at every level.  And we’ve been busy at it.  We actually, in the last year, set a record for most court of appeals judges confirmed in a single year in American history, and that doesn’t even count Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court of the United States.  (Applause.), And when it comes to security here at home, our President and I promised to stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line of law enforcement.  And so we have.  (Applause.), As we all know, the men and women of law enforcement risk their lives every day to serve and protect our families, our neighbors, and our communities.  And that’s why under President Donald Trump’s leadership, we’ve made new resources available to law enforcement at every level.  And we will continue to give all the heroes of law enforcement the training, tools, and the respect that they deserve as they protect our families in communities across this nation.  (Applause.), You know, the American people will always remember the heroes of the Dallas Police Department who fell in the line of duty nearly two years ago in that attack that claimed the lives of five officers and left nine others injured., Sadly, just last week, another brutal act of violence struck this city, leaving one Dallas Police officer dead and injuring another officer and a security guard.  I know I speak for everyone here when I say that we are praying for the family of Officer Rogelio Santander, and for the swift recovery of Scott Painter and Officer Crystal Almeida.  They are heroes, and they are on our hearts and in our prayers.  (Applause.), We live in challenging times, for as we all know, it hasn’t just been our law enforcement community that’s faced mindless violence of late.  We live in a time where mass shootings have claimed hundreds of lives in places of work, and worship, and public settings, shocking the conscience of the nation.  An ISIS-inspired attack on the Pulse Night Club, in Orlando.  An attack on a country music concert, last year, in Las Vegas — the worst mass shooting in modern history.  And the recent attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida., These, and too many other acts of violence, shattered families and left our nation searching for answers.  We mourn with those who mourn, and grieve with those who grieve.  But we also resolve to confront this menace with all our strength.  And we are doing just that under the leadership of this President.  (Applause.)  And I promise you, under President Trump’s leadership, we will not rest and we will not relent until we end this evil in our time., You know, in recent days, after these tragedies, America has seen President Trump’s leadership on full display.  He hosted a listening session at the White House with students, and teachers, and parents still grieving from the shooting in Parkland, Florida.  We listened to their stories.  We heard all sides of the debate.  I’ll never forget it., As the President has said, in his words, “It’s not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we’re making a difference.  We must actually make that difference.”  And so we have.  (Applause.), Just over one month ago, President Trump signed the STOP School Violence Act, with the strong support of the parents of Sandy Hook Promise and the NRA.  (Applause.), We’re now providing more than $2 billion to help local governments ensure the security of their schools and the safety of our students.  It represents the single largest investment in school safety in American history.  (Applause.), President Trump also signed critical legislation to fix the National Instant Background Check System to keep deadly weapons way from those who should never have them in the first place.  And we’re pursuing new resources to ensure that those struggling with serious mental illness have access to the treatment that they need.  (Applause.), With the President’s leadership, we’ve joined the NRA to call on states to give families and law enforcement the tools they need to stop mass shootings before they happen, because we know we can protect public safety and due process at the same time.  (Applause.), And President Trump has urged leaders all across America to follow the example of states like Indiana, and allow qualified school personnel on a voluntary basis to carry concealed weapons, because the quickest way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun!  (Applause.), This is real leadership, men and women.  And these are real results that will give law enforcement, families, and our schools new resources and tools to protect our students and ensure public safety., And I promise you we will continue to bring American solutions to bear on this crisis.  We will end this evil and protect our liberties at the same time.  That’s the American way.  (Applause.), The American people deserve to know about what we’ve done and what we’re doing, because quite frankly, most in the media won’t talk about it, and we all know why., AUDIENCE:  Booo —, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Most of the national media is working an agenda very different than most of us in this room.  I mean, not only does the media too often ignore what our President is accomplishing, but they also won’t tell the whole story about firearms in America., I mean, think about it: They focus on the tragedies and the heartbreak.  And well they should.  But too often, many in the national media all but ignore what happens when well-trained, law-abiding gun owners save lives.  It’s the truth.  (Applause.), And the reality is, throughout American history — it’s been proven time and time again — firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens makes our communities more safe, not less.  (Applause.), Let me tell you a few stories that you don’t hear much about in the national media, but they prove the point., Like the off-duty Marine in Atlanta, in 2009, who was attending a party that was overtaken by two would-be murderers.  After the attackers separated the men and women, Sean Barner was able to get to the concealed firearm in his backpack.  He killed one and ran off the other, preventing a terrible tragedy.  (Applause.), Or how about the passerby outside a Philadelphia barbershop in 2015.  He heard gunfire inside, he rushed in, he shot the attacker in the chest.  And the Philadelphia Police Captain said, “He saved a lot of people in there.”  And he did.  (Applause.), Or how about the Uber driver in Chicago, the same year, who saw a man open fire on a crowd of people on a Friday night.  He pulled out his concealed weapon, he engaged the shooter, he hit the attacker multiple times, and saved the lives of people on that street that he’s never even met.  (Applause.), Or the story from just down the road, in Arlington, Texas, where exactly one year ago yesterday, a crazed man entered a bar, killed the manager, was prepared to kill countless others, when he was stopped cold by another patron, a fella who took his wife to dinner that night and had a firearm at his side.  (Applause.), I mean, the truth is that these are the stories we don’t hear much about, yet they’re the stories that America most needs to hear., And so today, I want to call on the national media.  Start telling the whole story to the American people about firearms in this country.  (Applause.)  I mean, it’s time the national media gave our many heroes as much attention as they give to our few villains, because we should be a nation that recognizes the people who save lives much more than the people who take them.  (Applause.), It’s the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President.  (Applause.)  Truly is.  And I thank you all.  You know, the last two years have been filled with sights and sounds this small-town boy could’ve never imagined that I’d live to see., But for Karen and me, our most inspiring moment came in the wake of one of our nation’s darkest days, when we spent time with some extraordinary Americans not far from here, in a place called Sutherland Springs, Texas.  (Applause.), We all know the story — you just heard it again — of a Sunday morning in November when a deranged man entered the sanctuary of the First Baptist Church and murdered 26 believers, including 9 children, and injured 20 more., A few days after the attack, the President sent us to that small town to pray and to comfort and to stand with those families.  And it was our great honor.  (Applause.), We grieve with those who grieve, and we prayed.  But as the Good Book says, we did not grieve like those who have no hope –because the faith of those families, and the heroes minted that day, gave us hope.  (Applause.), Walking through the library at the nearby high school, we spent time with each of the grieving families just before a memorial service.  They were still shattered by the evil of that Sunday morning.  We saw the pain of unspeakable loss in their eyes.  But as I told Pastor Pomeroy, I just yesterday at the White House, Karen and I were so inspired by the faith in Christ that radiated out of every one of those families.  (Applause.), But it wasn’t just the faith of the families of the fallen.  That day, we also met, for the first time, the heroes of Sutherland Springs on a street corner just outside the church.  As America would learn on that fateful morning, when one man heard the gunshots, he ran toward the danger, his firearm in hand.  He shot the attacker twice.  And with another man’s help, they pursued that murderer in a high-speed chase., While the losses that day were indescribable, what was clear later is that it actually could have been worse.  The murderer had ammunition and arms that would have claimed even more lives, but for the courage of an NRA instructor and the newest recipient of the “Defender of Freedom” award, Stephen Willeford.  (Applause.)  Stephen, it is an honor to share this stage with you today., The Second Amendment is a shield for the rights of every American, and it’s a shield for the most vulnerable.  It’s the “great equalizer” that gives every American the power to defend themselves and their families against any evil in our midst., And for the sake of our freedom, for the safety of our people, and for the security of our nation, President Donald Trump and I will always stand for the right to keep and bear arms.  (Applause.), As I close, let me simply encourage you — encourage you to remember that our freedom always needs defending.  As my second favorite President, Ronald Reagan — (laughter and applause) — once said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”, And make no mistake about it, men and women: This is a pivotal year in the life of our nation.  And in this year, I want to challenge all of you — all the men and women of the National Rifle Association, here and across the country — stay in the fight; exercise all of your fundamental rights; live out the citizenship in a way that’s long made the NRA one of the most potent forces for good in the United States of America.  And do it this year.  (Applause.), Carry freedom forward.  Support men and women in public office who support our liberties.  And talk to your coworkers, and neighbors, and friends, and family at worship and at work.  Talk to them about the progress that we’ve made together, and all that we can do in the days ahead., Tell our story.  Tell what President Trump has meant to this nation in restoring our strength at home and abroad.  Remind them that we cut their taxes so they can keep more of what they earn.  (Applause.)  Remind them that we’re restoring American strength at home and abroad to protect their families and our freedom.  Remind them that we’re standing with law enforcement and all the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution.  Just go out there and tell them.  (Applause.)  Tell them we got the government working for them, not the other way around.  Go tell them that the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more!  You just go tell them, and tell them this year.  (Applause.), And if you’re of a mind, there’s one thing more I might urge you to do.  In this time of too much division in these United States, too much anger and even violence, I want to encourage you, if you’re so inclined, to bow the head and bend the knee in the days ahead, and pray for America.  (Applause.), And when you pray, pray with confidence, because I’ll always believe that those words recorded millennia ago that Americans have clung to throughout our history are every bit as true today as they’ve ever been in these divided times, that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll do like He’s always done through the long and storied history of this land: He’ll hear from heaven, and He’ll heal this land — (applause) — this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty, and justice for all.  (Applause.), Well, I need to get out of your way because your next speaker is about ready to come out.  (Applause.)  But I want to thank you for the honor of addressing you.  I leave here with renewed confidence, with the support of all the freedom-loving Americans gathered here and looking on across the country, with continued conservative leadership in the Congress of the United States, with President Donald Trump in the White House — (applause) — and with God’s help, we will make America prosperous again.  We will make America safe again.  And as he loves to say, we will make America great again., Thank you very much.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.), END, 1:23 P.M.

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, \\n2:45 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Let me start by saying what a meaningful experience it was to attend yesterday’s ceremony preceding the lying in honor of Reverend Billy Graham.  Reverend Graham left this Earth last week, but his legacy will live on for eternity., As the President said during his remarks, “Everywhere he went, Reverend Graham delivered the same beautiful message: God loves you.”  That’s a message that we should all stop and really consider a little more often.  The President and First Lady will also be attending Reverend Graham’s funeral in North Carolina tomorrow., I’d like to highlight some positive and important work the House did on Tuesday by passing H.R. 1865.  This bill empowers federal, state, and local prosecutors to hold websites accountable for supporting the sale of sex-trafficking victims., As you may recall, the President and Ivanka Trump met with survivors, law enforcement officials, and victims’ advocates here at the White House.  He made it clear that this administration will fight to hold sex traffickers accountable and to ensure survivors have the support they need., This bill is an important step forward.  And the White House appreciates the House taking action on a bipartisan basis., Earlier this week, I mentioned that we were going to begin regularly highlighting the historic obstruction of Senate Democrats, an issue that threatens the safety and security of the American people., As a reminder, compared to the four previous administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees.  Half of the President’s highly qualified nominees are still waiting on confirmation., Today, we have another example.  Two-hundred and seventy-six days ago, Kevin McAleenan was nominated to be Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  Kevin’s primary responsibility would be to help safeguard American borders, keeping both terrorists and their weapons out of our nation, all while facilitating lawful international trade.  Kevin should be preventing terrorists and contraband from entering the nation, yet he is still awaiting Senate confirmation., Senator Schumer should stop putting the safety and security of the American people at risk and immediately confirm him., And with that, I will take your questions.  John., Q    Sarah, the President announced, at the meeting a little while ago, punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that would take effect next week.  Ten percent for aluminum; twenty-five percent for steel.  He announced them even though the fine details have not been worked out yet about what countries will be involved, whether there are any exemptions.  The Dow is down about 500 points as a result of this.  Some of our allies, including Canada, are saying that these actions are unacceptable.  Why did the President announce them now, particularly before the details have even been worked out?, MS. SANDERS:  The President is announcing his intent to sign those actions next week.  We’re not going to get into any more details until those details are finalized, but that is what he intends to do next week, when he was making that announcement., Q    Is he concerned about the results or the effects that his announcement has had so far?, MS. SANDERS:  The President is concerned about the men and women of this country who have been forgotten about, the industries that our country was founded and built on.  And this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anybody.  This is something, frankly, the President has been talking about for decades; certainly something he talked about regularly on the campaign trail; and something that he’s delivering on, making that clear today.  And those details and that actual announcement and signing will take place sometime next week., Margaret., Q    Sarah, the President often talks about stock market reaction to his Presidency.  Is he surprised to see the market down after making this announcement without explanation on tariffs?  And do you have any detail on why he decided to announce it today?  As John was asking, you know, it seemed kind of sudden when we were called in for that event.  It wasn’t something on our, necessarily, public schedule., MS. SANDERS:  This is something, again, that the President has been talking about for a long time.  It’s not a surprise.   And we’re going to continue doing what we can to protect American workers.  That was something that the President committed to during the campaign.  This is something that he feels is vitally important., Q    But 25 and 10 percent is specific, and that was new., MS. SANDERS:  Yeah.  That part is new.  And he’s announcing his intent to make those things happen next week.  And we’ll have more details on that., Q    Did he make that decision today?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, this is something the President has wanted to do for quite some time., Q    But why was it a surprise to, you know, the press gathered there?  It wasn’t on the schedule when we were through —, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t think that the President always tells you guys everything first, but it’s certainly something he’s been talking about for a long time., Q    Well, it seemed like you haven’t told some at the White House, because there were these competing events., MS. SANDERS:  Look, these are conversations that the President has been having for a long time.  He’s made his intentions very clear to the team at the White House.  And I don’t think it came as a surprise to anybody here., Q    Can you say that 10 and 25 are set, or could that change between now and next week?, MS. SANDERS:  I think that’s the intent, but until those details are finalized, I’m not going to get into any more specifics right now., Zeke., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  A couple questions for you.  First, a number of the members of the President’s Cabinet have fallen under public scrutiny; in some cases, inspectors general, for spending, whether it be first-class travel.  In the case of Ben Carson, a $31,000 dining set.  The President talked about it on the campaign that he was going to drain the swamp.  So does he plan on draining some of his Cabinet?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t — in terms of if you’re asking if he’s getting rid of anyone on the Cabinet, I’m not aware that that’s taking place at any point right now.  To be clear, on Secretary Carson, the order that you referenced was cancelled and they’re looking for another option that’s much more responsible with taxpayer dollars., Q    Well, Sarah, you said a number of times that when the President loses confidence in a member of the Cabinet, he tells us.  So that means we haven’t heard that, so he has confidence in these people.  So can you explain why the President has confidence in some of these members of his Cabinet — in Carson, Shulkin, Pruitt, Zinke — there have been a number — there are numerous investigations into some of their conduct and spending?  So why do they have the President’s confidence?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, starting with the VA, with Secretary Shulkin, the President is glad for the job that he’s been doing in reforming the VA and modernizing the VA, a lot of the movements that they’ve had there.  And he supports him in those efforts., But they’re also — we have been reviewing these actions and making sure that we’re being very responsible with taxpayer dollars.  This is something that the President has asked all of his team to go back and look at., Q    Just one quick one on guns.  Senator McConnell, up on Capitol Hill, a few minutes ago, said that next week the Senate would not be moving forward with the Fix NICS legislation that Senator Cornyn has put forward, and Cornyn said that they’re going to be discussing (inaudible) regulation and potentially also human trafficking next week, and not gun legislation., After yesterday’s session, it seems that Republicans are running away from what the President wanted a, sort of, quick solution to this — a quick resolution on this front.  Why didn’t the President have the clout on Capitol Hill that a President — this is a Republican President, Republican Congress — why can’t he seem to get Congress to bend to his will?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t think it’s necessarily about bending to his will.  I think it’s about an ongoing discussion about the best pieces of legislation that they can put forward.  Yesterday was certainly an important part of that.  The President has met with a number of stakeholders.  Next week, he’ll also be meeting with members of the videogame industry to see what they can do on that front as well., This is going to be an ongoing process and something that we don’t expect to happen overnight, but something that we’re going to continue to be engaged in and continue to look for the best ways possible to make sure we’re doing everything we can to protect schools across the country., Cecilia., Q    Sarah, does the President want to get rid of his Attorney General?, MS. SANDERS:  Not that I know of., Q    And how about Jared Kushner?, MS. SANDERS:  No., Q    Is Jared Kushner becoming a distraction, given all the controversies that he’s been at the center of in recent days?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, Jared is still a valued member of the administration and he’s going to continue to focus on the work that he’s been doing, and we’re going to continue pushing forward on that front as well., Q    And are there any concerns about conflict of interest, given those meetings that he had with executives from companies that gave his family business millions of dollars in loans?, MS. SANDERS:  I would refer you to the statement that was put out by his attorney., Q    But conflict of interest appearance even?  Concerns about that here at this White House?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I would have to refer you to the statement put out by his attorney., Jon., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Back on the tariffs announcement.  Is the President concerned about the impact that this may have on America’s allies, like Canada, the UK, the EU?, MS. SANDERS:  The President’s biggest concern is making sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect American workers, and that was what his announcement on his intentions next week are specifically geared towards.  This isn’t something that he’s shied away from or something that he hasn’t spoken about regularly and often, or something that he’s going to stop talking about at any point soon., Q    Is the President concerned about any retaliation coming from any of the countries that may be impacted by this announcement?, MS. SANDERS:  Not that I’m aware of., Q    And one final thing.  Just wanted to ask you about a comment and get your reaction to — Republican Senator Ben Sasse put out a statement in regards to these new tariffs.  He said that, “The President is proposing a massive tax increase on American families.  Protectionism is weak, not strong.”  And he concluded by writing, “You’d expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.”  Do you have a comment on that?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t know that the President will, or should ever, apologize for protecting American workers.  And certainly not to Senator Sasse., Blake., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Let me try to drill down on this.  You say you won’t be getting into details at this point.  So if there are details to get into, should we read into it that there will be exemptions for certain countries?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of the final details that will be put out next week.  At this point, there’s no additional information to share as this is all being finalized., Q    Has the President made up, in his mind, which countries he might exempt or at least is considering?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get into any details on this front and I don’t have anything further to add on his intentions that will take place next week., We’re a little bit tight so I’m going to keep moving.  Jordan., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  Yesterday was the deadline that Chairman Gowdy set for the White House Chief of Staff to reply to his questions about security clearances at the White House.  Was that request met?  Did the Chief of Staff send a reply to Chairman Gowdy?, MS. SANDERS:  We’re having conversations with the committee and we’re going to continue working with them.  And I can’t go any further than that at this point., Q    Do you have, at least, the time you think that you might answer the committee?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, we’re in regular conversations with them and we’re going to continue working with them., Trey., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  This week, the President expressed frustration with his Attorney General and the Department of Justice as it relates to the process to look into FISA abuses.  What would the President like to see done differently?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, the President has made clear that he has a lot of concerns, like you said, with the current FISA process.  Nothing makes the problems of FISA cleaner than what was outlined in both the Republican and Democrat memos., The FBI used political campaign material to get a warrant to spy on American citizens.  They failed to disclose to the judge that the dossier was funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, even as it was being used to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  Obviously, that alone shows us that the process needs to be looked at closely and reformed to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect the privacy of American citizens., Q    And as it relates to that tweet, could you elaborate on the relationship between the President and the Attorney General?  Does President Trump believe his Attorney General is disgraceful?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, the President has made his frustrations very clear.  I don’t have anything else to add., Dave., Q    What was the President’s reaction to what the Mayor of Oakland, California, did last weekend when she tipped off residents that there was an imminent immigration raid coming?  Does he feel that the mayor broke the law, and now the Justice Department is looking into that?, MS. SANDERS:  I think it’s outrageous that a mayor would circumvent federal authorities, and certainly put them in danger by making a move such as that.  And that’s currently under review by the Department of Justice, and I don’t have anything else to add., Olivier., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  I got two for you.  First, I know you’re averse to providing details about the tariff plan.  Does the President plan to couple the tariff plan with any policies to mitigate the impact on, say, the auto industry?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I don’t have anything else to add at this point., Q    And, very open ended, did you take note of President Putin’s speech?  And do you have a reaction to his rhetoric and threats about these invincible weapons?, MS. SANDERS:  Yes.  President Putin has confirmed what the United States government has known all along — which Russia has denied — Russia has been developing destabilizing weapons systems for over a decade in direct violations of its treaty obligations., President Trump understands the threats facing America and our allies in this century and is determined to protect our homeland and preserve peace through strength.  U.S. defense capabilities are, and will, remain second to none.  And now, because of the new defense budget of $700 billion, our military will be far stronger than ever.  As the President’s Nuclear Posture Review made clear, America is moving forward to modernize our nuclear arsenal and ensure our capabilities are unmatched., John., Q    Yeah.  Thank you, Sarah.  Two short questions.  First, can you confirm or deny that the President has made a decision to go for the outside for a successor to Hope Hicks as Communications Director, rather than promote from within?, MS. SANDERS:  The decision on that hasn’t been made.  I don’t have a personal announcement., Q    The other thing is that the President has a good relationship with Senators Manchin of West Virginia and Toomey of Pennsylvania.  Has he been in touch with either of them to discuss further the proposed universal gun ban that’s been floated around since last week?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that they were both a part — attended the meeting earlier this week.  The President also spoke, I believe, with Senator Toomey earlier today, but has not seen that final legislation, as discussions are still ongoing.  And so I can’t say where we fall in position on that piece of legislation at this point., But he is continuing to have conversations and is going to continue to be engaged with members of Congress across the board., Francesca., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions was due to be at the White House today for the opioid summit.  Did the President have an opportunity to speak to him while he was here?, MS. SANDERS:  Not that I’m aware of., Q    Okay.  And then moving on to gun violence prevention.  The President said yesterday that he would sign a bill, and then he said, “And I will call whoever you want me to if I like what you’re doing.”  If Senators, if the House, if Congress, passes a bill that does deal with school safety, gun violence, is the President committed to signing whatever they pass?, MS. SANDERS:  The President is not going to unilaterally say without seeing that piece of legislation.  But he does want Congress to come together and put forward a piece of legislation that addresses the safety in schools and gun violence, specifically.  And he laid out a number of things he’d like to see in that, and so we’re hoping that Congress will continue working with us and put a strong piece of legislation forward., I’m going to take one last question.  The President — hey, guys, hold on just a second.  The President is headed over to speak at the opioid summit here momentarily., I’ll take one last question.  Sarah., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  So according to the White House readout, there was a phone call this morning between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and President Trump.  Moon Jae-in briefed him on the inter-Korean talks.  The South Korean government is also saying that they plan to send a special envoy to North Korea soon.  How does the President feel about the dialogue between North and South Korea?  Does he welcome it, or is he concerned?  And does he feel that President Moon is being too soft on North Korea?, MS. SANDERS:  The President wants to continue working with South Korea as a strong ally, and we have no daylight between the two of us.  We’re going to continue those conversations.  Again, the ultimate goal is to denuclearize the Peninsula.  That’s what we’re focused on.  And we’re excited about any steps moving forward in that process., Thanks so much guys.  I’m going to move out.  The President will be speaking here in a couple minutes., END, 3:01 P.M.

       "      <td>[Westin Book Cadillac Detroit Hotel, \\nDetroit, Michigan, 4:39 P.M. EST, THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Michigan. (Applause.) It is great to be back in Michigan, great to be back in Motor City, U.S.A. (Applause.) And it’s great to be back with so many men and women who elected a President and majorities in Congress who, just two over months ago, enacted historic tax cuts that put America first. (Applause.), And speaking of which, I bring greetings from a man who just loves Michigan and a leader you voted to make the 45th President of the United States of America. I bring greetings from President Donald Trump. (Applause.), We got a lot to talk about today. But before I get started, let me do as your Attorney General just did, and take a moment to address the news out of Central Michigan University today. I know it’s on everyone’s hearts and minds, and it’s on the hearts and minds of people across this country., Now, the facts are still coming in. Our hearts go out to the fallen, to everyone in the Mount Pleasant community that’s been impacted, and especially to the local, state, and federal agencies who are working together, as we speak, on the apprehension and the investigation. We can be proud of the men and women who serve in law enforcement. (Applause.) Thank you., Our hearts are heavy. Another shooting on another campus. It comes in the wake of the terrible shooting that took place at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that claimed the lives of 17 innocent students and teachers, and injured 14 more. There were the terrible attacks in Las Vegas and in Sutherland Springs, where the worst attack on a place of worship in American history took place., You know, as a nation, we mourn with those who mourn, and grieve with those who grieve. And I know I speak on behalf of everyone here when I say that today, and every day, we’re going to continue to pray — continue to pray for all the victims and their families from all of these terrible events., When it comes to our schools, President Trump said it well: “No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school.” (Applause.) Ever. And as the President told the nation’s governors this week at the White House, school safety is now the top priority of the Trump administration. (Applause.), And I’ll make you a promise, Michigan: Working with federal and state leaders, we’re going to strong action to strengthen background checks, to give our schools and law enforcement the resources and flexibility to keep our kids safe. And we’re going to work to give families the tools they need to deal with those struggling with dangerous mental illness., As the President said in a meeting with members of both political parties in the Congress, at the White House, just the day before yesterday, “We have to act” — and we will. We’ve got a lot of work to do. (Applause.), With the President’s leadership, and the support of members of Congress and strong partners in the state, I promise you from my heart: This President, this administration, will not rest until we make our schools safe again. (Applause.) So, thank you for that., And let me also say thank you — thank you for that great introduction and the great leadership and service to the people of Michigan of Attorney General Bill Schuette. (Applause.) I’m honored to be joined by your Attorney General. He’s a man of integrity and great devotion to this state., I’m also, gratefully, joined by an old friend of mine and a great friend of President Trump’s. He’s been an ally of this administration, he’s a tireless champion for the working men and women of Michigan — Congressman Tim Walberg is with us today. (Applause.) And you’ll hear more from him., And finally, I want to thank our host today: an organization that’s working tirelessly to promote the policies that are making a real difference in the lives of Michiganders and in the life of our nation. Join me in thanking America First Policies for bringing us together for this great occasion. (Applause.), You know, it’s great to be back in Michigan and in the great city of Detroit, where people work hard, look out for one another, love this state and this country that we all call home., You know, if President Trump were here with us here today, I have a feeling he’d tell you exactly what he said the last time he was in Michigan. In his words, and I quote, “I love this state, and I love the people the people of Michigan.” That’s what he said, and I agree. (Applause.) So, it’s true., Now, I’m really here today on the President’s behalf, on all of our behalf, first and foremost to say thank you. Thank you, Michigan, for everything you’ve done to stand with our administration — not just in an election in 2016, but every single day since. Because of your support and your hard work in the past year, I’m pleased to report to you the first year of this administration has been a year of action, it’s been a year of results. In a word, it’s been a year of promises made and promises kept. (Applause.) True. Thank you., AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!, THE VICE PRESIDENT: I mean, think about it. President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy. And in just a few short weeks, President Trump is going to sign the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.), He promised to stand with America’s law enforcement. And today, we’re once again giving the men and women on the Thin Blue Line the respect and resources they deserve. (Applause.), And President Trump promised to enforce our laws and secure our borders, and today, illegal crossings on our southern border are down by nearly 50 percent. (Applause.) And I’ll make you a promise: We’re going to build that wall. (Applause.), Beyond our borders, the President promised to restore American leadership and credibility on the world stage. And under President Donald Trump, America once again stands without apology as the leader of the free world. (Applause.), We’ve taken the fight to the terrorists on our terms, on their soil. And thanks to the courage of the Armed Forces of the United States, and the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief, ISIS is on the run, their caliphate has crumbled, and we will not rest or relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source. (Applause.), And we put the leading state sponsor of terror on notice, as well, and made it clear that we will no longer tolerate Iran’s destabilizing activity, and the United States of America will no longer certify the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. (Applause.), And in the wake of their provocations and threats against our nation and our allies, this President has made it clear that when it comes to North Korea, the era of strategic patience is over. (Applause.), And I promise you, the United States of America will continue to stand strong with our allies until North Korea stops threatening our people, threatening our allies, and finally, and lastly, abandons their nuclear and ballistic missile program once and for all. (Applause.), And here at home, the results have been just as dramatic. We’ve taken decisive action to restore the rule of law and rev the engine of the American economy. First off, this President promised to appoint strong conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And as I stand here today, President Trump appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and set a record for the most court of appeal justices in one year in American history. (Applause.) That’s a record of judicial appointments., We promised to unleash the American energy that fuels the Motor City. President Trump approved the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. He rolled back the Clean Power Plan. And President Donald Trump put American manufacturing and America first when he withdrew our nation from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.), We also promised to roll back the heavy hand of government on American free enterprise. In fact, back on the campaign trail, some of you might remember that President Trump said, we’re going to cut two federal regulations for every new regulation that goes on the books. (Applause.), But you know what? After our first year, President Trump has actually eliminated 22 regulations for every new federal rule on the Code of Federal Regulations. (Applause.), We promised to stand up for American workers and American business. And under President Trump’s leadership, we’re also cracking down on unfair trade practices, and we are fighting for trade deals that are fair and reciprocal, and put American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.), And finally, President Trump promised to cut taxes across the board for working families and job creators large and small. And just a little more than two months ago, President Trump, right before Christmas, kept his promise to the American people when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. That’s promises made, promises kept. (Applause.), So in this White House, it’s about strength and growth for our nation and our people, and it’s working. We’re only one year into this administration, and already the results are, frankly, nothing short of remarkable. (Laughter.), You know, I’m from Michigan’s favorite neighbor — (laughter and applause) — the great state of Indiana. And I remember a little bit of friendly competition we had with Michigan and football season. And March Madness is just around the corner. But we also competed for jobs and businesses every single day. While I’ll always be a little partial to the Hoosier State, I got to give it to you, Michigan is leading the American comeback like never before. (Applause.) You are. It’s true., I mean, since Election Day 2016, think about the progress we’re making. Businesses large and small across America have created 2.5 million new jobs, including 58,000 new jobs right here in Michigan in the last year alone. (Applause.), Unemployment hasn’t been this low in 17 years, and more Americans are working today than ever before in our nation’s history. And as the President announced just yesterday, jobless claims are at a 49-year low. (Applause.), Here in the Motor City, unemployment has dropped more than 10 percent since Election Day 2016. And across the state, construction jobs are at a 10-year high., And while thousands of manufacturing jobs disappeared in the last year of the last administration, President Trump promised to fight for the men and women who run our factories, build our cars, and make the nation proud with every product that bears those four beautiful words, as the President calls them: Made in the USA., And after just one year, under President Trump’s leadership, manufacturing in America is back. (Applause.) Amazing. American companies have created nearly 200,000 new, good-paying manufacturing jobs, including nearly 6,000 new jobs across Michigan alone., And after eight years of a stagnant economy, where wages wouldn’t budge, Americans are seeing their paychecks rise faster than any point in nearly a decade, because growth is back, confidence is back, and under President Donald Trump, America is back. (Applause.), But as the President likes to say, at this White House, that’s just what he calls a good start. (Laughter.) The truth is, the best days — the best days for American prosperity, we believe, are yet to come, because those tax cuts are just starting to make a difference. I mean, we cut taxes on working families, giving the typical Michigan family of four $2,300 of their own hard-earned money. We slashed taxes on American businesses so Michigan manufacturers can compete and win more effectively with businesses anywhere in the world. (Applause.), And we didn’t just cut taxes on income and on businesses. We gave the American people the relief they’ve been crying out for: We repealed the Obamacare individual mandate tax. (Applause.) It is gone. Off the books., And it’s working. Since President Trump signed these new tax cuts into law, over 400 companies nationwide have announced more than $480 billion in new investments in American jobs and in American workers., In fact, here in The Motor City, you might have heard Fiat Chrysler is giving out $2,000-tax-cuts bonuses to all of its workers. And they’re going to move their entire production line from Mexico to Michigan, and create 2,500 new good-paying jobs — (applause) — and invest another billion dollars. Let’s hear it for Fiat Chrysler saying yes to America and yes to Michigan. (Applause.) Thank you, Fiat., And as President Trump pledged to the people of this city one year ago, so I say to all of you today: Under our administration, we’ll forge, in his words, a “new future of American automotive leadership.” And it’s happening right before our eyes right here in the car capital of the world. (Applause.), It’s not just America’s automakers that are growing and investing in their workers. In fact, in just the past two months, more than 4.3 million Americans across the nation have already gotten a raise or a bonus thanks to the President’s tax cuts. (Applause.), All told, as businesses continue to invest in their workers, we expect that Michiganders, overall — when all the tax cuts are fully implemented and have their effect — people across this state are going to see their paychecks rise by about $4,000 a year, all because of the tax cut passed by these great leaders in Congress you’ll hear more from later, and the tax law advanced by President Trump., And let me take this moment to thank — thank the leaders in Congress and Michigan who supported this tax cut, including Congressman Walberg and his Michigan colleagues in the House of Representatives for standing strong and putting Michigan first. Give them a round of applause, would you, please? (Applause.), I mean, they voted, in a very real sense — the representatives in Congress from Michigan who voted for this tax cut voted to give Michigan workers a raise. But that can’t be said for the two U.S. senators who represent your state in Washington. Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters voted “no.”, AUDIENCE: Booo —, THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, Debbie Stabenow called tax cuts, “A bad deal for the people of Michigan.” Senator Debbie Stabenow said, “The proof is in your paycheck.” But you know what? You know what? In a way, she’s right. The proof is in your paycheck. (Applause.) Your paychecks are getting bigger because the Trump tax cuts are working for Michigan and they’re working for America. (Applause.), I mean, Michigan families are already paying less in taxes, getting more in raises and bonuses, and bigger benefits. Today, the hardworking men and women of Michigan are reclaiming hope and confidence in a brighter future. And that’s what those tax cuts are all about. And that, sadly, is what both of your senators voted against. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I just think the people of Michigan deserve better in the United States Senate. (Applause.), Be assured, President Trump and I are going to keep fighting for you. We’re going to keep fighting for all the hardworking people across this state, and we’ll always keep putting your interests first., Just a few weeks ago, President Trump unveiled our plan to rebuild America, as well. I don’t know if you noticed, but you elected a builder to be President of the United States. (Laughter.) And under President Trump, we’re going to give the American people the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways and airports in the world. (Applause.) We’re going to rebuild America., And we’re going to keep fighting for trade deals that are free and reciprocal, and that put American workers first. We’re going fix a broken immigration system. We’re going to do it, as the President said, in his words, with “policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.”, Folks, President Trump and I are going to keep making good. We’re going to keep making good on all of the promises that we’ve made to the people of Michigan., AUDIENCE: Thank you! (Applause.), THE VICE PRESIDENT: But, you know, the most important work in America is always done by the American people; not by their elected officials at any level. The most important work of this nation doesn’t take place in the marbled halls of our nation’s capital; it happens in cities just like this one, in towns all across America. The people of this nation are the beating heart of America. And every single one of you, every day, gets the credit for the Michigan comeback and the American comeback. You’re the ones making it happen., You’re the ones around kitchen tables — a parent helping a child with their homework. You’re the ones working the long shifts, like truck drivers and construction workers pulling a double shift, facing a long day’s work just to be able to have hard-earned pride of somebody who helps power the economy of a great nation., You see that greatness and that difference in neighbors helping neighbors every day in places like Detroit, a city that has passed through some challenging times in recent decades. But now, Detroit is emerging stronger and better than ever before. And you’re doing what you’ve done so many times in your long and storied history., You’re a city whose people continue to live up to the Motor City motto, “We hope for better days; it shall rise from the ashes.” You’re a people who continue to inspire the nation with your grit, your character, and your boundless capacity to reinvent yourselves and to renew the American Dream. That’s the Michigan spirit for you., It’s a spirit, I’m told, actually resides in the walls of this very building where we gather today. I guess, when it first opened its doors back in 1924, the Book was the tallest, most state-of-the-art hotel in the world. But like so much that’s happened to this great city in hard times, the Book fell on hard times as well. By the mid-1980s, Hotel Book Cadillac had shut down and fallen into disrepair. You all saw it happen. For more than 20 years, this beautiful building sat empty and abandoned, but it was never forgotten by the people of Detroit., Eventually, the same dream that inspired the Book brothers to build the world’s tallest hotel launched a revitalization of Book-Cadillac in our own day. And 10 years ago, this hotel, the grand lady of Washington Boulevard, reopened its doors and reclaimed its rightful place as the crown jewel of Detroit. (Applause.) That’s the Michigan spirit and that’s the American spirit., It’s a spirit that’s been restoring our country over this last year as well, and even now fills our nation with optimism, hope, and a renewed sense that our best days lie ahead — because they do., So as I close, I want to urge each and every one of you, from everything you hear from this forum today, to go out and talk about Michigan’s renewal and America’s renewal. Talk about it to your friends over a backyard fence outside a CVS. Talk about it at your place of worship and your place of work. I mean, talk about everything they’re not hearing about on cable television. (Laughter and applause.) Are you with me?, I mean, tell them what they’re not hearing about on most of your cable channels. Tell them everything that we’ve accomplished because of the leadership that we’ve elected from the President on down, and how it’s making a real difference in their lives and in the life of this great nation. Tell them we cut their taxes, so they can keep more of what they earn. Tell them we’re restoring American strength at home and abroad, so their families can sleep safe at night., Tell them that we’re putting Washington back to work for them, not the other way around; and that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) You go tell them that. You go tell them that. That’s your part., And in these challenging times of too much division in this great nation, if you’re of a mind, there’s one more thing I’d encourage you to do. Just a few short hours ago, President Trump and I were in Charlotte, North Carolina, where we had the chance to bid farewell to one of the greatest Americans of the past century, the Reverend Billy Graham. (Applause.), Billy Graham was a man of towering faith, whose ministry for the Gospel and his matchless voice transformed countless lives, inspired our nation, and changed the world. His message transcended politics. It sprung from what has always been, I believe, for millions of Americans what Billy Graham called a “hope for the present and hope for the future.”, So today, I encourage you, if you share that same conviction, I encourage you to take advantage, any opportunity you have, to bow the head and bend the knee, and pray for our country. (Applause.) Pray for all those who serve in uniform at home and abroad. Pray for all of us that have the privilege — the privilege in this great nation to serve the people of the United States., And when you pray, pray with confidence. Because I really do believe those ancient words inscribed a millennia ago are still as true today as they ever were — that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll hear from heaven and He’ll heal this land. (Applause.) This one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all., So thank you for the opportunity to spend some time with you on a Friday afternoon after a long —, AUDIENCE: Thank you! (Applause.), THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I just want to promise you: With the continued support of every one of you in this room and the good people of Michigan, with the strong support of our partners in Congress who are standing with this President every day to put America first, with President Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I know we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. (Applause.), Thank you very much. God Bless you. Thank you, Michigan., END 5:09 P.M. EST]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[The Greenbrier Resort, \\nWhite Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, 6:44 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Jim.  (Applause.)  That is a great gentleman.  And he’s a big man, isn’t he?  He’s a big man.  Big Jim.  And thank you to Cathy, very much, it’s an honor.  Please sit down.  Thank you very much., West Virginia is truly blessed to have someone like the governor and wonderful first lady.  And I just want to say that I love this state, which I happened to win by 42 points over a Democrat.  (Applause.)  Forty-two points.  That’s like one of these genius golfers winning by nine, you know?  It’s like the same thing., But I want to thank everybody.  I spent the last three days interviewing and thinking about Supreme Court Justices, such an important decision.  And we’re going to give you a great one.  We’re going to announce it on Monday.  And I think you’ll be very impressed.  These are very talented people.  Brilliant people.  And think you’re going to really love it, like Justice Gorsuch.  We hit a home run there and we’re going to hit a home run here.  And, step by step, we are making America great again.  (Applause.), So Jim asked me to do this.  I mean, you know, he did switch from Democrat to Republican.  You don’t see that often.  (Laughter.)  So it’s hard for me to say, “No, I’m not coming.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “I’m coming, Jim.”  And it’s a beautiful place.  And I watch these tournaments.  I have such respect for these golfers; these great, talented — nobody knows how good they are.  They’re really talented athletes., But we’re gathered here on the eve of the 4th of July to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible, our brave servicemembers and our wonderful veterans.  We love our veterans.  (Applause.)  Love our veterans., For 242 years — it’s a long time — American independence has endured because of the sweat, blood, and sacrifice of the American armed forces.  We’d be — yeah, you’ve probably been hearing, we may add a little thing called “Space Force.”  We have Air Force — “Space Force.”  (Applause.)  I don’t know if anybody wants to hear that.  But we’re thinking very seriously about it because space is becoming very important militarily, as well as other reasons.  But it’s the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world., During both the Civil War and the World War II, the Greenbrier served as a hospital for wounded soldiers, so it’s so appropriate.  Tonight at the Greenbrier’s first annual Salute to Service dinner, we’re calling upon this rich history, and we’re carrying no the PGA’s proud legacy of supporting America’s heroes., Joining us for tonight’s ceremony are many incredible golfers who will be competing at the Greenbrier this week.  And I’ll be sitting home at the White House and I’ll be watching and saying, “I wish I could play like that.”  (Laughter.), Among those with us — I just said hello to a few of them — Bubba Watson.  He’s having a good year.  Where’s Bubba?  Where is he?  Boy, Bubba.  (Applause.)  He is having a good year.  Thank you, Bubba., Keegan Bradley.  Keegan.  Great.  (Applause.)  Thanks, Keegan.  Thanks.  Thanks, Keegan.  That putter is working.  I just said, “That shorter putter’s okay.”  (Laughter.), Longest hitter I’ve ever seen, big John Daly.  John?  (Applause.)  John.  Boy, he’s — John, I played with John in a tournament that we won — meaning that he won.  (Laughter.)  He won.  You know, it’s funny, he won and then I go back.  Everyone said, “How’d you do?”  “I won.”  (Laughter.)  Right, John?  He’s something., And Phil Mickelson.  Phil, I’ll tell you.  (Applause.)  I’ll never forget, I was at — this is — I don’t think Phil can remember this, but like, 15 — where’s Phil?  Where is that guy?  He’s so incredible., But it was about 15 years ago, and I was “Donald,”  and I’m watching, and the place is packed with people.  And Phil’s there, and he sees me, and I’ve liked Phil.  And Phil, I think, likes me.  And he’s on the third hole and it’s a big deal, a big tournament.  And he said, “Oh, excuse me, just a second.”  And he gets up, hits a ball — it was a three wood — he hits a three wood, like 280 [yards] right down the middle.  Then he comes back, “Okay, good.  So how’s everything else?”  (Laughter.)  And I said, “That really is special talent.”  That’s the office, Phil, right?  That’s just the office.  So it’s really amazing.  What a great career.  What a great gentleman., I really want to thank Jim Nantz for leading this evening’s program.  Jim, wherever you may be.  Where’s Jim?  (Applause.)  There’s a great, great job.  Hi, Jim.  Great job, Jim.  Really good., And Slugger White.  He keeps everybody honest, right?  Where is Slugger?  Slugger has done a fantastic job.  Nobody plays games with Slugger.  (Applause.)  I know, at Doral, I tried to move the tees back, and I — he couldn’t, he just wouldn’t let me do it.  (Laughter.)  There was no doubt about it.  Right, Slugger?  Slugger is great., And all of the PGA officials, tournament staff, and the volunteers for their incredibly hard work in putting this really incredible event together.  And the job that Jim Justice has done with the course is really spectacular., Also, with us this evening, is acting VA Secretary — he’s doing a phenomenal job at the Veteran’s Administration — Peter O’Rourke — Peter?  Peter?  (Applause.)  Good job, Peter.  Done a lot of work at the VA., Along with West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito — who’s a good golfer, by the way.  (Applause.)  Shelley.  Good golfer, Shelley., And Congressmen Alex Mooney and Morgan Griffith.  Where are they?  (Applause.)  Great.  Thanks, fellas.  Tremendous help to me, getting things passed.  You think it’s easy in Congress.  Not easy.  That’s why I have the great — if I didn’t introduce them as an example today, they’d never vote for me again.  (Laughter.)  That’d be the end of your taxes.  That would be the end of everything., I also want to thank our great Attorney General from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey — (applause) — who is fighting a great grace.  Patrick?  And congratulations to Patrick, running for the U.S. Senate.  And he is a tough, strong guy.  And he ran an incredible race against some very talented people, and he won.  And now he’s got another race and it’s going to be — I see the polls have it very close.  You may be surprised to see what’s going to happen.  He’s got incredible energy, incredible strength, and he loves the people of West Virginia, like, a lot.  So good luck, Patrick.  We’re proud of you.  Great job.  (Applause.), Speaker Tim Armstead and Majority Whip Carol Miller.  I want to thank you very much for being here.  And Carol, good luck in the race.  I know you’re going to do well.  I know you’re going to do well.  (Applause.), And we’re honored to have with us the Adjutant General of West Virginia, Major General James Hoyer of the National Guard.  The “Big Cheese.”  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, General.  Thank you very much., Tomorrow, families across our nation will gather to celebrate the 4th of July.  As we do, we will think of the men and women serving overseas at this very moment — far away, far, far away from their families — protecting America and watching over our people.  They are there, and they are with us, and they are brave.  These are incredible people., And we will thank God for blessing us with these unbelievable heroes.  To everyone here tonight that has served our nation in uniform, will you please stand so we can express our gratitude?  Please stand.  Please.  (Applause.), Tough cookies.  Tough cookies.  And you know, when it comes to ICE, and Border Patrol, and all of these incredible people that you’ve been reading about who are doing an unreal job, we want border security, we want security in our country.  We respect ICE., You know, ICE is the one.  These are tough people.  And you have to be tough.  And when they have a problem with MS-13 gangs and all of these others that came in through these horrible and weak immigration laws that, Shelley, we’re strengthening up — we’re going to get them done.  We need tough laws.  We need fair laws.  (Applause.), But when these people come into our country and come in illegally, and then they’re dispersed throughout the country, and all of a sudden you see nests of MS-13 — you know, it’s like you’re liberating towns.  We sent ICE in.  And for ICE, it’s just another day.  Like Phil and John and Keegan, all of the guys, and Bubba — like the way they play golf:  They go; they play.  They don’t know.  It’s hard.  They don’t know what that is., These guys, they walk into those areas, they take them out of there so fast.  They’re not afraid of anything.  It is — it’s like you’re liberating a town.  Like in a war, you’re liberating a town or an area.  And ICE goes in there, and they go in there, and sometimes they have to go in swinging.  They don’t mind.  They’re tough., And then I hear Democrats saying, “We want to abandon ICE.  We want to abandon.”  We’re not abandoning ICE.  And we’re not abandoning our law enforcement.  (Applause.)  Just the opposite., So I want to recognize, today, a legendary hero from West Virginia, a veteran who fought in Iwo Jima.  In February of 1945, he volunteered to dash straight into enemy fire to destroy vital enemy fortifications and to clear a path for American forces to continue forward.  He went right into the machine gun nests.  John Daly wouldn’t do that, and he’s a pretty tough (inaudible).  John, would you do that?  I don’t think so.  Definitely hurt your golf game, John.  That’s the end of golf.  (Laughter.), In the face of bullets and bayonets, he risked his life for his brothers-in-arms, and he earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.  (Applause.), Today, Woody Williams is 94 years old.  He has dedicated his life to supporting Gold Star families and building memorials to honor our fallen servicemembers.  In 2016, thousands were moved by Woody’s patriotic words when he spoke at one of our rallies in West Virginia.  He was incredible.  I still remember it.  And of course, we all remember that wonderful moment when Woody flipped the coin at this year’s Super Bowl., Woody, you are a national treasure, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  (Applause.)  Woody, where are — where is Woody?  Where is Woody?  Thank you, Woody.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Woody., Brave man.  Ninety-four.  I give a lot of Congressional Medals of Honor.  When I say a lot, probably five so far.  And it’s really one of my greatest honors to do it.  The Congressional Medal of Honor.  It’s our highest honor.  Woody, fantastic.  So often I’m giving them posthumously where they’re just not around.  But we hear the stories, and their families are there, and everyone is proud.  But every once and a while, we have one that can be given to people that are living, like you, Woody.  So thank you very much., We’re also deeply moved and honored to be joined by a Gold Star Spouse who knows the true price of freedom, Christine Pusateri.  Christine’s husband, Chris, was a Sergeant in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.  Great group.  Chris was killed in action in Iraq in 2005., Christine, tonight we send the love and gratitude of our entire nation.  Your husband was a special man.  We will hold you and your precious family in our hearts forever.  Christine, where are you?  Christine.  Christine.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Christine.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Christine., And, Christine, through your husband’s heroic sacrifice, you understand that he has achieved immortality.  And our debt to him, and to you, is eternal and everlasting.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, darling., From Bunker Hill to the beaches of Normandy and the jungles of Vietnam, Americans in every generation have given their last breath, their last measure of love, and their final moments on this Earth in defense of their country and their countrymen., Our servicemembers have fulfilled their duty to America a million times over.  Now, we must fulfill our sacred duty to them.  We must protect those who protect us., When our servicemembers are in uniform, it is our obligation to ensure that they have the finest equipment, the finest training, care, resources — better than any military on Earth.  And when our servicemembers return to civilian life as veterans, we must ensure they have access to the best care, treatment, and support in the world., We are restoring American security by rebuilding our great military.  We have secured, this year — with the help of Shelley and your great Congressman — a record $700 billion for our military.  And next year, $716 billion — most amount ever.  We’re rebuilding our military., And when have we needed it more?  Outside of wars themselves, when?  Think about it.  And we’re building it so big, so powerful, so strong.  Stronger than we’ve ever been.  And hopefully, we’ll never have to use it., And as the golfers can tell you, the stronger we get, the less likely it is that we will have to use it.  But we’ll be at a point, the likes of which we’ve never been as a power.  And again, hopefully never having to use that incredible equipment that is built right here.  Best in the world, in the U.S.A.  (Applause.), We also gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in eight years.  So they got a pay raise.  And it was about time.  They’ve been waiting for a long time.  (Applause.), And I’m proud, that under my Administration, we’ve passed the largest VA reforms in half a century.  I signed into law, just recently, the VA Accountability legislation.  And just so you understand, accountability — you couldn’t fire anybody in the VA.  They could be sadists.  They could be late.  They could be bad.  They could have lots of problems.  They could talk back to you.  You couldn’t do a thing., For 40 years, they’ve been trying to get it passed, and we got it passed.  It’s called VA Accountability.  And as I’ve said before, we now look at the person that violates our great veterans, and we say, “Jim, get the hell out of here.  You’re fired.”  (Applause.), And we can do it.  Now, we can do it.  You couldn’t (inaudible).  If they’re no good — and if they’re good, we reward.  We have a lot of great people., As promised, we opened the White House VA Hotline, and have instituted new transparency on wait times and quality of care.  We are processing veteran claims more quickly than ever before.  We’re expanding healthcare, so that our great veterans can get care anywhere, and at anytime., And maybe most importantly — I don’t know, accountability is important, but this is another one.  I used to be very proud of myself when I’d be on the campaign trail, and I’d say, “You know, why don’t they just pay a doctor to take care?”  Because, as you know, sometimes veterans will stand on line for days and days, for weeks., Can you imagine Phil Mickelson going to the doctor, and they’ll say, “Good, he should be there in about 12 days”?  Twelve days.  That’s not acceptable, Phil.  Right?  It’s not acceptable., So what we’re doing is — now, if there’s a wait, if there’s a problem, you’re going to a doctor that might be right across the street.  You’re going to get taken care of immediately., People would wait so long; you’d wait weeks.  You’d stand on line.  You’d literally come back day after day.  So now we have what’s called “VA Choice.”  And I used to say, “Why don’t they do that?”  I didn’t know anything.  I thought I was totally brilliant.  I thought this was the greatest idea.  Then I went to tell people about it, and they said, “Yeah, we’ve been trying to get that passed for years.”, So I was very good at getting it passed because we got it passed three weeks ago.  So now you have VA Choice where if you have to wait, you go to a doctor, we pay the doctor.  (Applause.)  So it’s great, and we’re very proud of that.  And we’re very proud of what’s happening at the VA., In order to maintain our security as a nation, we understand that we must have economic strength as well.  And nobody believes it; if I would have said it, they would have said, “What a horrible thing to say, what an exaggeration.”  The fake news — they’re all back there.  They’re all back there.  (Laughter.), If I would have shot a 75, they’d say, “There’s no way he could do it.  There’s no way.”  (Laughter.)  They might be right about that, actually.  (Laughter.), But they are back there.  They would have said there’s no way — 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day.  They would have said, “No way.”  They would have said, and a lot of people would have said.  (Applause.), Unemployment claims are at the lowest point in 44 years.  That means people are working again.  (Applause.)  African American unemployment is in the lowest it’s ever been.  The history of our country — it’s at the lowest in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  Remember I used to say “What do you have to lose?  Vote for Trump.  What do you have to lose?”, Hispanic American unemployment, the lowest in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  By the way, women — I was saying, two weeks ago, “21 years.”  Now, I’m saying, “66 years.”  I think, within two weeks, I’ll be saying “the lowest in history.”  The lowest unemployment in 66 years.  (Applause.), Last year, in West Virginia, per capita personal income grew more than 40 percent faster than the national average.  Coal exports — you remember I said “Coal.  Coal.  Clean coal.”  Jim, clean coal.  Right?  We always say “clean coal.”  And what they can do now is incredible with coal.  Clean coal exports skyrocketed by more than 60 percent nationwide, and I’m so proud of that., When we came here, I met with the miners.  And I talked to the miners, and I talked to (inaudible) about different way of life.  They didn’t want to hear about it.  They love digging coal.  That’s what they like.  They love — their grandfathers, their fathers, their families.  And coal is coming back., And it’s also coming back for another reason: national security.  And your governor knows very well, and your senator knows very well what that means with coal.  You know, you bomb a pipeline, that’s the end of the pipeline.  With coal, that stuff is indestructible.  (Laughter and applause.), You can move it around on a truck, you can dump it at the plant, you can do whatever the hell — you can rain on top of it for a long time.  Right, Jim?  It can rain like crazy.  You can do whatever you want — snow, sleet, wind.  You just dump it.  It’s there.  You hit those pipelines, they’re gone, and that’s the end of it.  You’re saying, “Man, we better go out and start cutting some lumber.”  (Laughter.)  So for national security purposes, I don’t think people talk about it enough — coal., America is winning again because we’re finally putting America first.  We’re putting our country first.  Tomorrow, we commemorate 242 years since our forefathers adopted the Declaration of Independence., In their quest to become a sovereign nation, they knew they would have to defeat the most powerful military on land or on sea.  They knew that.  They knew that, as they met, thousands upon thousands of British troops were disembarking outside of New York City, preparing to crush the revolution.  They were going to crush it quickly.  They weren’t even actually taking it seriously., These patriots knew that their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor were on the line.  They risked it all for the promise of more of a just and better future.  They wanted this great future in this incredible land.  They made the same brave choice as countless others who followed in the generations after them: the choice to stand strong for their families, their principles, their pride, and their God-given rights., Every time we see an American in uniform, any time we have the chance to shake the hand of a veteran, and whenever we hear the stories of our warriors, we are reminded how truly blessed we are to be American and to live in this land of our great heroes — you.  Our great heroes., This 4th of July, let us pledge to renew the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as Americans.  Let us pledge to expand the blessings of liberty, prosperity, and justice to all of our citizens.  And let us always remember that we are one people and one nation, saluting one great American flag.  (Applause.), I want to thank you — to every one of these incredible athletes that are here today.  These are PGA players.  These are unbelievably talented people.  They’re talented in their mind and in their body.  Their muscles are strong, but their mind has to be stronger.  It’s tough.  And these are tough people.  These are incredible people.  So I want to thank all of you for being here tonight.  It’s an honor for me, especially as a golfer.  (Applause.)  It’s an honor for me., I want to thank Big Jim Justice.  Stand up, Big Jim, come on.  (Applause.) He’s about 6’10 and he weighs about — I’m not going to say 450; I won’t do that to you, Jim.  But he’s a big man, and he’s done a great job., Do you know that West Virginia is second in the nation in the percentage increase of GDP?  Think of what that means.  (Applause.)  And Jim just said, “Before we met Trump, that number was not good.”  Pretty close to last, right?  And combinations of a lot of good people with Shelley, and you, and us., But now, think of that.  Texas was first.  Texas.  Doing a great job.  Great governor there, too.  But Texas was first.  West Virginia was second — percentage increase of GDP.  That’s an incredible accomplishment in a short period of time.  Incredible.  (Applause.), I want to thank everyone at the Greenbrier for making this tournament a beautiful tribute to our military.  And thanks again to all of the veterans here tonight, and all across America.  We love you, we thank you, and we will never, ever forget you., God bless our Veterans.  God bless America.  And Happy Independence Day to all.  Thank you very much.  This is a great honor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.), END, 7:10 P.M.

       "      <td>[Roosevelt Room, \\n2:35 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  Big day.  Very important day.  We have a lot of important days at our White House.  And this is, to me, the future., I want to thank you all for being here to discuss a critical issue for our country’s future: winning the race to be the world’s leading provider of 5G cellular communications networks.  It’s all about 5G now.  We were at 4G, and everybody was saying, “We have to get 4G.”  And then they said, before that, “We have to get 3G.”  And now we have to get 5G, and 5G is a big deal.  And that’s going to be there for a while.  And I guess, at some point, we’ll be talking to you about number 6.  What do you think?  (Laughter.)  Do you think that’s true, Ajit?, But, right now, we want to be the leader in this.  We’re the leader in almost everything else., And we’re grateful to be joined by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who’s been doing a fantastic job, and Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky.  Thank you very much, Stephen.  Appreciate it.  And tell Sonny “hello.”  He’s doing a tremendous job.  Really tremendous., Secure 5G networks will absolutely be a vital link to America’s prosperity and national security in the 21st century., \\n5G will be as much as 100 times faster than the current 4G cellular networks.  It will transform the way our citizens work, learn, communicate, and travel.  It will make American farms more productive, American manufacturing more competitive, and American healthcare better and more accessible.  Basically, it covers almost everything, when you get right down to it.  Pretty amazing., And just as 4G networks paved the way for smartphones and all of the exciting breakthroughs — they made possible so many things — this will be more secure and resilient.  5G networks will also create astonishing and really thrilling new opportunities for our people — opportunities that we’ve never even thought we had a possibility of looking at., We cannot allow any other country to out-compete the United States in this powerful industry of the future.  We are leading by so much in so many different industries of that type, and we just can’t let that happen.  The race to 5G is a race America must win, and it’s a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in.  We’ve given them the incentive they need.  It’s a race that we will win., In the United States, our approach is private-sector driven and private-sector led.  The government doesn’t have to spend lots of money.  According to some estimates, the wireless industry plans to invest $275 billion in 5G networks, creating 3 million American jobs quickly — very quickly — and adding $500 billion to our economy., And, as you probably heard, we had another alternative of doing it; that would be through government investment.  And leading through the government, we don’t want to do that because it won’t be nearly as good, nearly as fast.  And especially in that business, I think that they’ll be better doing the job than a lot of the folks who we know and love., To accelerate and incentivize these investments, my administration is focused on freeing up as much wireless spectrum as needed — we’re going to free it up so they’ll be able to get out there and get it done — and removing regulatory barriers to the buildout of networks., As Chairman Pai will discuss with you in a moment, the FCC is taking very bold action — probably bolder than they’ve ever taken before; it’s a new frontier — to make wireless spectrum available.  By next year, the United States is on pace to have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world.  That’s a big statement because, as you know, some people got ahead of us.  We should have been doing this a long time ago, as advanced as it may be., In addition, last October, I directed the Department of Commerce to develop a National Spectrum Strategy to free up even more spectrum for economic activity, including 5G., The FCC has also taken action to streamline the permitting process for 5G infrastructure with state and local governments.  That’s a big deal.  It takes too long to get permits.  We’re going to free that situation up, and we’re going to put limits and the local areas are going to listen to us very, very strongly.  They have a big incentive to do that., They must now approve new physical infrastructure within 90 days, instead of many years.  It can sometimes take three, four, and five years.  We’re going to put a limit of 90 days.  And there is now a cap on the unreasonable fees local governments often charge.  They get greedy.  They think, “Hey, we can really take advantage.”  And it ends up that everybody gets hurt.  So we’re putting a cap on those fees.  These changes will contribute greatly to building high-speed networks across America.  And it’s going to happen very quickly.  Very, very quickly., By the end of this year, the United States will have 92 5G deployments in markets nationwide.  The next nearest country, South Korea, will have 48.  So we have 92, compared to 48.  And we’re going to accelerate that pace greatly., But we must not rest; the race is far from over.  American companies must lead the world in cellular technology.  5G networks must be secure.  They must be strong.  They have to be guarded from the enemy — we do have enemies out there — and they will be.  They must cover every community, and they must be deployed as soon as possible., As we are making great progress with 5G, we’re also focused on rural communities that do not have access to broadband at all.  And we have a couple of people from the great farms that I love, that I’m sure voted for me.  I won’t ask them, but they seem — (laughter) — I think they, for the most part — yes?, PARTICIPANT:  Yeah., THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I think, for the most part, they did.  I think — I know that almost automatically.  I’d be very surprised., But I have to say, I’ve been talking about broadband for the — for rural America — the farmers and others.  They have really been — they just haven’t been treated properly.  And now, what we’re doing is we’re making it a priority.  That’s the areas we want to go to first, so they’re covered., We’re working closely with federal agencies to get networks built in rural America faster and at much, much lower cost than it is even today., So now I’d like to introduce a very special man who’s really worked hard and gained the respect of the world, truly — because they see what we’re doing in our country — who will making two major announcements to accelerate our 5G future and extend broadband access to every American., No matter where you are, you will have access to 5G.  And it’s going to be a different life.  I don’t know that it’s going to be better.  Maybe you’re happy the way it is right now — (laughter) — but I can say, technologically, it won’t even be close., So, Chairman Pai, thank you very much.  Please, say a few words., Thank you very much, Ajit., MR. PAI:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Appreciate you.  (Applause.), Well, thank you, Mr. President, for you your compelling vision of U.S. leadership on 5G.  I also want to thank Larry Kudlow, the Director of the National Economic Council, for your steadfast support of this vision., Mr. President, as you observed, America must win the race to 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity.  And this matters for two key reasons:, The first is national competitiveness.  We want the good-paying jobs that develop and deploy 5G technologies — jobs that support some of the folks in this room — to be created here, in America.  We want these technologies to give our economy a leg up as we compete against the rest of the world., The second reason U.S. leadership matters is that 5G will improve Americans’ lives in so many ways, from precision agriculture, to smart transportation networks, to telemedicine, and more.  We want Americans to be the first to benefit from this new digital revolution while protecting our innovators and our citizens.  And as you pointed out, Mr. President, we don’t want rural Americans to be left behind., And, Mr. President, that’s why I’m pleased to report that America is now well positioned to win the race to fast, secure, and reliable 5G.  And don’t just take my word for it.  In February, ABI Research stated, and I quote, “It is the United States who will win the 5G race in the short term.”  That same month, Cisco projected that, in three years, 5G would be more than twice as prevalent in North America as in Asia., Last week, CTIA reported that America leads the world with the most commercial 5G deployments of any nation., And just this past Tuesday, it was reported that 5G-related job listings here in the United States increased 12 percent in just the past three weeks according to data from an online job search service., Today, 5G is a success story — an American success story.  Well, how are we getting the job done?  As the lead agency on 5G, the FCC is pursuing a three-part strategy called the 5G FAST Plan.  First, we’re freeing up spectrum, the invisible airwaves that carry wireless traffic.  We finished our first 5G spectrum auction in January, and we’re holding a second, right now, that has already generated almost $2 billion in bids., Second, we’re making it easier to install wireless infrastructure.  5G will rely heavily on a web of small antennas.  But when I came into office, regulations designed for tall towers threatened to strangle our 5G future in red tape.  We have eliminated these rules, because infrastructure the size of a pizza box shouldn’t have to jump through the same regulatory hoops as a 200-foot cell tower., And third, we’ve taken action to encourage the deployment of optical fiber.  That is because 5G isn’t just about wireless.  We’ll also need strong fiber networks to carry 5G traffic once it goes from the air to the ground.  And we’ve done a lot to make that happen, including ending heavy-handed regulations imposed by the prior administration., And here, too, we are getting results.  Last year, fiber was deployed to more new locations in the United States than in any year before.  But in the race to 5G, our early success is still early.  We still need to do more, and we will., And so today I’m announcing two new steps the FCC will take to build on our momentum.  First, the FCC intends to start its third 5G spectrum auction on December 10th of this year.  This will be the largest spectrum auction in American history.  We will be selling 3,400 megahertz in three different bands.  And for those of you who aren’t wireless experts, that is a lot of spectrum., Second, to help build the infrastructure of the future, the FCC aims to create a $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund headed by the agency.  This money will extend high-speed broadband to up to 4 million homes and small businesses in rural America.  These next-generation networks will bring greater economic opportunity to America’s heartland, including some of the great jobs building infrastructure, and they will help support future 5G technologies., In closing, I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for your leadership on 5G.  Your White House has advanced your vision in many ways, from international treaty negotiations to much-needed regulatory reforms.  I appreciate all these efforts, and in the same spirit, this FCC will help build a great and lasting legacy of American success on 5G., Thank you, Mr. President., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Ajit.  Very good.  (Applause.), Ivanka worked very hard on this.  Maybe say a couple of words, Ivanka?  Please., MS. TRUMP:  Sure.  Well, thank you.  And thank you, everyone, for being here today.  Obviously, American dominance in the industries of the future is predicated on connectivity and digital connectivity.  And 5G is the future., And so I think everyone in this room feels very comfortable to know it’s in your very capable hands.  And, President, we thank you for your leadership on this critical issue., And I’m so glad that we were able to include in today’s discussion our priorities on rural broadband.  So that is something that, from the earliest days of the administration, we’ve sought to really deliver on.  And with today’s announcement, in addition to the milestones that have been achieved over the last two years, we can say that we’re bringing 5G and rural broadband across this country., So, really, thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, honey.  (Applause.), Would you like to say something on behalf of the farmers and our great people?  Please., MR. SMITH:  Certainly.  Mr. President, we really appreciate the fact that you have put this emphasis on rural America., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right., MR. SMITH:  The things that you have done in office have been tremendous for us.  We look forward to the next several years of you continuing to do that., The thing that you struck today, though, of deregulation, broadening it out, and letting the American business, letting the American farmers and ranchers fix the problems of this country, really rings hard with us.  That’s what we try to do and that’s what we’ll take forward to build this nation., Thank you for your help., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.), MR. MILLER:  Mr. President, Chairman Pai, on behalf of the National Association of Tower Erectors, our 900-member companies, we build, deploy, and maintain the wireless infrastructure of this nation.  And you all are fixing to put us to work, and we appreciate it.  (Laughter and applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  And your people do an incredible job, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  What a great job., And they go up high.  How high do you go?, MR. RAY:  I’ve been up 800-foot., THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And somebody said 200 feet and sometimes more.  That’s a long way up., And you feel very safe, right?  Huh?  Who said 200? (Laughter.), MR. MASSENGALE:  A thousand., THE PRESIDENT:  A thousand?  Come here.  Come here., PARTICIPANT:  That’s a big tower., THE PRESIDENT:  Come here.  (Laughter and applause.), How high do you go?, MR. MASSENGALE:  Up to 1,000 feet., THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want that job.  (Laughter.), Thank you very much.  Thank you all very much.  I appreciate it.  This is going to be a great, great thing., Q    Mr. President — Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah., Q    — can you tell us your plans about sanctuary cities and illegal migrants?  (Inaudible.), THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, the people that are putting sanctuary cities where they’re not even wanted — because as you know, in California and other places, a lot of communities want to get out of sanctuary cities; they don’t want them.  But they always seem to have open arms., So we thought rather than moving the illegal immigrants to other parts of the country — first of all, we’re getting them and we’re doing the best we can with very bad laws.  We have to change the laws.  But we’re apprehending thousands and thousands of people a day, and the law only allows us to hold them, as you know, for 20 days because of the most ridiculous laws, probably, we have in this country., If Ajit had laws like that for 5G, you wouldn’t have anything built.  You’d never have the first cell put up., But we have horrible, old-fashioned laws that are put in by the Democrats.  We’re willing to change them.  We can do it in — I used to say 45 minutes; we can do it in 15 minutes — whether it’s catch and release or chain migration or any of them., The asylum laws are absolutely insane.  They come up.  In many cases, they’re rough gang members.  In many cases, they’re people with tremendous crime records and they’re given a statement to read by lawyers that stand there waiting for them, “Read this statement.”  And it says, “I have great fear for my life.  I have great fear for being in my country.”  Even though, in some cases, some of these people are holding their country’s flags and waving their country’s flags.  And then they talk about the fear they have of being in the country — that the flag they were waving freely., So we are looking at the possibility — strongly looking at it, to be honest with you.  California, the governor wants to have a lot of people coming in, refugees coming in.  A lot of sanctuary cities.  So we’ll give them to the sanctuary cities, maybe, to take care of, if that’s the way they want it — because we can only hold them, under the current law, for 20 days.  So we apprehend them by the thousands and thousands a day., I have to say Border Patrol has been incredible.  The job they’re doing is incredible.  The wall is going up.  It’s going up fairly rapidly.  We’re doing another big section.  We start another big section tomorrow.  But we’re building miles and miles of wall., And we’re going to have — I think we’ll be close to 400 miles built by the end of next year.  We need that.  Just got back from Texas, and some of the ranchers told me — you look at Brooks County, you look at other places — some of the ranchers told me you have bodies lying all over the land of people where the coyotes give them a can of soda and they give them a sandwich and they say, “Houston is 300 miles in that direction.”  And the people don’t know what that means.  That means they can’t make it.  That means they have no chance and they die.  It’s something I never heard.  I never heard it to this extent.  Many people die.  And they’ll say, “Just head in that direction.”, And we are doing a lot about it.  If we had the wall, we wouldn’t have that.  If we had the wall, people wouldn’t be coming up.  Mexico is now apprehending and bringing back to the various countries that we’re talking about — Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador — they’re bringing people back to those countries; Colombia, to a certain extent — and they’re going back to those countries., But we could fix that and so fast if the Democrats would agree.  But if they don’t agree, we might as well do what they always say they want: We’ll bring the illegal — really, you call them the “illegals.”  I call them the “illegals.”  They came across the border illegally.  We’ll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it, whether it’s a state or whatever it might be., California certainly is always saying, “Oh, we want more people.”  And they want more people in their sanctuary cities.  Well, we’ll give them more people.  We can give them a lot.  We can give them an unlimited supply.  And let’s see if they’re so happy.  They say, “We have open arms.”  They’re always saying they have open arms.  Let’s see if they have open arms., The alternative is to change the laws, and we can do it very, very quickly, very easily.  Okay?  Okay?, Q    Are you asking for more troops on the border as well?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to put more troops on the border, yeah.  We’re going to.  And, you know, the thing is, our country is doing so well economically.  We’re setting records that a lot of people are coming up for that reason.  A lot of people are coming up for bad reasons too., We have a lot of very, very bad people with big criminal records trying to get through.  And the Border Patrol has done an incredible job with them.  Those are our focus.  They really have done a really incredible job.  And when they have been through, and when they’ve been let through over the years — ICE — all over Long Island — and they come and they get them and they take them back, and we get them the hell out of here., That’s happening all over our country.  ICE.  But the job that ICE and that, really, Border Patrol does is an incredible job.  And law enforcement in this country is — the job they’re doing is really incredible., You know, I don’t know if you saw the crime stats, but the statistics are that crime is way down in our country over the last year.  Way, way down.  And so that’s despite all of the problems we have at the border.  And we’re straightening that out., So, on sanctuary cities, as per your question, we are giving very strong consideration to having people — after a 20-day period — because, again you’re not allowed, legally, to hold them for more than that — we will move them into sanctuary cities., Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you., END                 2:57 P.M.

       "      <td>[South Lawn, 8:10 A.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  We just had news that Turkey released a prisoner that we were trying to get, and they released him a little while ago into home custody and will be released from home custody to the United States pretty soon.  And I just want to thank President Erdoğan.  We dealt with that, and he was — it was great., They released this prisoner, hostage — whatever you want to call him.  He’s at home custody, in Turkey.  He’ll be released fairly soon, so that’s good news.  I guess, probably, you know about that., Other than that, I think things are going very well.  The economy is doing fantastically well, beyond any expectation.  Unemployment numbers are just about the best in the history of our country.  Employment numbers are the best.  We have close to 160 million people working today, which is more than we’ve ever had before., I’m going out to Colorado today to give the commencement address for the Air Force, which is actually very exciting for me.  It’s an amazing place.  These are great people.  So I look forward to doing that., Any questions?, Q    What did you make of Mueller’s statement yesterday?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it was the same as the report.  There wasn’t much change. It was, to me, the same as the report.  And there’s no obstruction.  You see what we’re saying.  There’s no obstruction, there’s no collusion, there’s no nothing.  It’s nothing but a witch hunt.  This is a witch hunt by the media and the Democrats.  They’re partners., And it keeps going.  I thought it was finished when the report was released, but it goes on.  And, to me, it was the same, frankly, as the report.  And he said, basically, it was the same as the report., Q    Do you still think Robert Mueller behaved honorably?, THE PRESIDENT:  I think he’s totally conflicted.  Because, as you know, he wanted to be the FBI Director, and I said no.  As you know, I had a business dispute with him.  After he left the FBI, we had a business dispute.  Not a nice one.  He wasn’t happy with what I did, and I don’t blame him.  But I had to do it because that was the right thing to do.  But I had a business dispute., And he loves Comey.  You look at the relationship with those two.  So whether it’s love or deep like, but he was conflicted., Look, Robert Mueller should’ve never been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he didn’t get it.  And the next day, he was picked as Special Counsel.  So you tell somebody, “I’m sorry, you can’t have the job.”  And then, after you say that, he’s going to make a ruling on you?  It doesn’t work that way.  Plus, we had a business dispute.  Plus, his relationship with Comey was extraordinary., Now, one other thing I’ll say: Why didn’t he investigate Strzok, and Page, and McCabe, and Comey and all the lies, and Brennan and the lies, and Clapper and the lies to Congress, and all of the things that happened to start this investigation?  Why didn’t Comey come clean?  Why didn’t Comey come clean and say the things that he knows are fact?  Why didn’t Mueller investigate Comey, his best friend or his very good friend?  And there are so many other things., Here’s a question.  This is a study of Russia.  Why didn’t they invest the insurance policy?  In other words, should Hillary Clinton lose, we’ve got an insurance policy.  Guess what?  What we’re in right now is the insurance policy., Q    Do you think he behaved dishonorably?, THE PRESIDENT:  I think he is a total conflicted person.  I think Mueller is a true Never Trumper.  He’s somebody that dislikes Donald Trump.  He’s somebody that didn’t get a job that he requested that he wanted very badly, and then he was appointed.  And despite that — and despite $40 million, 18 Trump haters, including people that worked for Hillary Clinton and some of the worst human beings on Earth — they got nothing.  It’s pretty amazing., Q    Do you believe that Russia helped you get elected?, THE PRESIDENT:  No, Russia did not help me get elected., Q    That’s what it said (inaudible)., THE PRESIDENT:  You know who got me elected?  You know who got me elected?  I got me elected.  Russia didn’t help me at all.  Russia, if anything, I think, helped the other side.  What you ought to ask is this: Do you think the media helped Hillary Clinton get elected?  She didn’t make it, but you take a look at collusion between Hillary Clinton and the media.  You take a look at collusion between Hillary Clinton and Russia.  She had more to do, in the campaign, with Russia than I did.  I had nothing to do., And, by the way, that’s one other thing.  If you look, this was all about Russia, Russia, Russia.  They don’t talk about Russia anymore because it turned out to be a hoax.  It was all a hoax.  And then they say, “Gee, he fought back.  Isn’t that terrible?  He fought back.”  Of course, I fight back.  Because it was a false accusation — a totally false accusation.  And it’s a disgrace.  And it’s a very — it’s a very sad period for this country., And I think, in the end, I will consider what’s happening now to be one of my greatest achievements: exposing this corruption., Q    Do you think they’re going to impeach you?, THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t see how they can.  Because they’re possibly allowed, although I can’t imagine the courts allowing it.  I’ve never gone into it.  I never thought that would even be possible to be using that word.  To me, it’s a dirty word — the word “impeach.”  It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word.  And it had nothing to do with me., So I don’t think so, because there was no crime.  You know, it’s “high crimes and…” not “with” or “or.”  It’s “high crimes and misdemeanors.”  There was no high crime and there was no misdemeanor.  So how do you impeach based on that?, And it came out that there was nothing to do with Russia.  The whole thing is a scam.  It’s one of — it’s a giant presidential harassment.  And, honestly, I hope it goes down as one of my greatest achievements because I’ve exposed corruption — I’ve exposed corruption like nobody knew existed., Q    China says it’s going to restrict (inaudible) and rare earth elements if your trade strategy (inaudible)., THE PRESIDENT:  I think we’re doing very well with China., Come here, I want to shake your hand.  Come here.  You’ve treated me fairly.  Thank you.  Thank you., Q    Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Wait.  I want to answer a real reporter’s question.  We’re going to answer a real reporter’s question, okay?, China would love to make a deal with us.  We had a deal, and they broke the deal.  I think, if they had to do again, they wouldn’t have done what they did.  We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs.  China is subsidizing products.  So the United States taxpayer is paying for very little of it.  And if you look at inflation and if you look at pricing, it’s gone up very little., The tariffs are having a devastating effect on China.  People are fleeing the country with their companies.  These companies are leaving for Vietnam, other parts of Asia, and they’re even coming to the United States because then there’s no tariff., I think we’re doing very well with China.  We’ll see what happens.  But I can tell you China very much wants to make a deal because the companies are leaving China to avoid the tariff.  China is becoming a very weakened nation, just as Iran has become a very weakened nation.  And Iran wants to make a deal also., Q    Will you see Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage in the UK?, THE PRESIDENT:  Say it?, Q    Will you see Boris or Mr. Farage?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I may.  Nigel Farage is a friend of mine.  Boris is a friend of mine.  They’re two very good guys.  Very interesting people.  Nigel has had a big victory; he’s picked up 32 percent of the vote, starting from nothing.  And I think they’re big powers over there.  I think they’ve done a good job., Q    Would you support either of them?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I like them.  I mean, they’re friends of mine, but I haven’t thought about supporting them.  Maybe it’s not my business to support people.  But I have a lot of respect for both of those men., Q    On the USS McCain, do you think it’s fair to the sailors of the John McCain that they were banned from hearing you speak simply because they (inaudible)?, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I don’t know what happened.  I wasn’t involved.  I would not have done that.  I was very angry with John McCain because he killed healthcare.  I was not a big fan of John McCain in any way, shape, or form.  I think John McCain had a lot to getting President Bush — a lot to do with it — to go into the Middle East, which was a catastrophe., To me, John McCain — I wasn’t a fan.  But I would never do a thing like that.  Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn’t like him, okay?  And they were well meaning, I will say.  I didn’t know anything about it.  I would never have done that., Q    Do you owe the sailors of the McCain an apology?, \\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, not at all.  I heard sailors all went on.  We had a tremendous group of sailors from various ships.  It was a beautiful day.  But the McCain thing, I knew nothing about., Q    What are you doing to (inaudible) foreign adversaries from interfering in 2020?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think I’ve been much tougher on elections than President Obama.  President Obama was told, in 2016, just before the election in September, that Russia may try and interfere with the election.  He did nothing.  And the reason he did nothing is he thought Hillary was going to win., \\nWe are doing a lot, and we’re trying to do paper ballots, as a back-up system, as much as possible.  Because going to good, old-fashioned paper, in this modern age, is the best way to do it., Q    (Inaudible) talks with President Putin?  What does the U.S. gain from that?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we want to have a relationship with Russia and China and everybody.  And I’ve said that for a long time.  Getting along with Russia, getting along with China is a good thing if we can do it on fair terms or our terms., Q    (Inaudible) with Venezuela?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Venezuela — we’re just on watch.  We’ll see what happens.  I’d love to see them work out their problems.  I understand there are a lot of talks going on.  But I’m all for the people of Venezuela.  You know that probably better than anyone., Steve, go ahead., Q    In Israel, Netanyahu has been failing to form a coalition.  Are you worried about that?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s too bad what happened in Israel.  It looked like a total win for Netanyahu, who’s a great guy.  He’s a great guy.  And now they’re back in the debate stage and they’re back in the election stage.  That is too bad, because they don’t need this.  I mean, they’ve got enough turmoil over there.  It’s a tough place.  I feel very badly about that., It looks like they’re talking, but more likely they’ll have to go back into election mode.  That’s too bad., Q    The Mueller report said Russia was trying to help you and hurt Hillary Clinton.  Was Mueller wrong about that?, THE PRESIDENT:  I believe that Russia would rather have Hillary Clinton as President of the United States than Donald Trump.  The reason is: Nobody has been tougher on Russia than me.  Whether it’s our energy policy, which was not hers; whether it’s the pipelines, as you know, in Europe, going all over the place that I’ve been bitterly complaining about; whether it’s Ukraine; whether it’s a whole host of things — there has nobody ever been more tough or difficult for Russia than Donald Trump., Now, I have to tell you this: I put sanctions on Russia at a level that nobody has seen before.  Nobody even wants to write about it., With all of that, I want to get along with Russia, and I want to get along with China, and I want to get along with Europe.  I want to get along with everybody, if it’s possible.  I even want to get along with Iran, and Iran wants to talk.  And if they want to talk, I’m available.  Thank you., Q    (Inaudible) what you hope to do?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to be staying at Doonbeg, in Ireland because it’s convenient and it’s a great place.  But it’s convenient.  We’ll be meeting with a lot of the Irish officials, and it’ll be an overnight stay.  And I look forward to that., Q    What will you be discussing with the Taoiseach?, THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of the things that you (inaudible)., Q    Mr. President, do you think the White House should apologize for (inaudible) John McCain?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I can’t because I didn’t know anything about it.  I don’t know who did it.  We’ll probably be able to find out who did it.  They thought they were doing me a favor because they know I am not a fan of John McCain.  John McCain killed healthcare for the Republican Party and he killed healthcare for the nation.  I disagree with John McCain on the way he handled the vets, because I said you got get to Choice.  He was never able to get Choice.  I got Choice.  I disagreed with John McCain on the Middle East.  He helped force Bush to make a very bad decision and go into the Middle East., So, I wasn’t a fan of John McCain and I never will be.  But certainly, I couldn’t care less whether or not there’s a boat named after his father., Q    Robert Mueller did not say “no obstruction.”  He said he did not feel he could charge with you a crime because (inaudible)., THE PRESIDENT:  There were no charges.  None.  If you look at — if you look at Bill Clinton, that very nice gentleman who’s been so much on my side, as you know, his special prosecutor — it was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.  So many guiltys.  With me, there was no guilty.  Number one, there was no crime.  And number two, I fought back.  And I’ll tell you —, Q    (Inaudible) said he couldn’t say “no crime.”, THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Well, here was no collusion.  There was no collusion.  Read volume one.  There was no collusion., Q    (Inaudible.)  He said he could not say there was no crime.  He could not clear you., THE PRESIDENT:  That means you’re innocent.  That means you’re innocent., Q    He said he couldn’t say you were innocent., THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me — then he should’ve said “you’re guilty.”, Q    But he said he couldn’t do that because that would be unfair.  (Inaudible.), THE PRESIDENT:  That’s wrong.  That’s wrong.  No.  Because he said it — he said it differently the first time.  So he said, essentially, “You’re innocent.”  I’m innocent of all charges.  And, you know, the thing that nobody brings up: There was no crime.  They’re saying “he’s obstructing something” and there was no crime.  And nobody brings it up., Also, someday, you ought to read a thing called Article 2.  Read Article 2, which gives the President powers that you wouldn’t believe.  But I don’t even have to rely on Article 2.  There was no crime.  There was no obstruction.  There was no collusion.  There was no nothing.  And this is from a group of people that hate me.  If they only found anything, they would’ve had it.  And he knows that better than anybody., Q    He did not say that you were innocent.  He said he did not —, THE PRESIDENT:  There was no crime, there was no charge because he had no information., Q    Do you agree with Louisiana’s ban on abortion at six weeks?  Is that a good law?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to have a statement about it.  And I’m also going to have, probably today, a major statement on the border.  This is a big league statement.  But we are going to do something very dramatic on the border, because people are coming into our country — the Democrats will not give us laws.  They will not change laws.  They will not meet.  They will not do anything.  They want to have open borders.  They want to have crime.  They want to have drugs pouring into our country.  They want to have human trafficking.  I’m going to be making a statement probably tomorrow but maybe today., Q    Are you closing the border?, THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m not closing the border.  I’m doing something else., We’re going to be having a major statement on the border sometime later today or tomorrow., Q    What’s the (inaudible) of it?, THE PRESIDENT:  It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border.  And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border.  We have brought something to the light of the people.  They see now it’s a national emergency, and most people agree.  The Democrats agree too, but they won’t give us the legislation you need to fix it., Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them.  They won’t give us the legislation.  Whether it’s chain migration or whether it’s lottery, they won’t give us any.  And the asylum procedures are ridiculous.  No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws., So I will be making a major statement — I would say my biggest statement — on the border, probably today or tomorrow., Thanks., END, 8:27 A.M.

       "      <td>[U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro, \\nSan Diego, California, 12:23 P.M. PDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Vice Admiral Fagan.  Thank you for those stirring words.  Thank you for your outstanding leadership and your service to the nation.  Would you all join me in thanking Vice Admiral Fagan one more time — (applause) — for her outstanding leadership of the Pacific Fleet of the U.S. Coast Guard?, To Captain James Estramonte, thank you for the hospitality on this momentous occasion of this historic offload after the maiden voyage of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro.  It’s a great honor for me to be with you., I’m also honored to be here with two great leaders in the fight against drug cartels and drug trafficking.  Join me in thanking Director Jim Carroll and Actor — Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon.  These are friends of mine, and they are in the fight against drug trafficking in this country.  (Applause.)  Thank you., But most of all, it’s an honor to be with all of you, to be able to say “welcome home” after three months of deployment, where each one of you, every single day — as evidenced by the contraband that surrounds us on this deck and that will be offloaded here today — that you truly are gallantry in action.  Let’s hear it for the men and women of the United States Coast Guard Cutter Munro.  Job well done!  (Applause.), Before I talk about the work that you’ve done, allow me to bring greetings from a great fan of the Coast Guard — someone who the Admiral and the Captain know has been a champion of the Guard, making sure that you have the resources and the support to do the mission that the American people cherish the Coast Guard to do every day: not only interdicting in drug trafficking, but saving lives on the high seas., So allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), I came here today on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, and on behalf of the American people, to say thank you.  Thank you for a job well done, and welcome home.  You’ve been keeping watch, and you’ve been protecting American families on this mission., You know, the President just said last week, in his words, “Coasties…secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists…[And] when the red racing stripes of a Coast Guard vessel break the horizon…those in distress know that help is on the way, and our enemies know their time has come.”  Thanks for proving that on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro, on your first mission.  (Applause.), And let me commend you, especially, for your new deployment to the Eastern Pacific corridor.  I’m told that “East Pac” is the route for 80 percent of the cocaine that makes it to America, enslaving Americans through addiction, destroying families and communities, and claiming lives., Even though this is a new area of deployment for this cutter, you’ve already proven yourselves more than up to the task.  Today’s offload totals more than 39,000 pounds of cocaine, 933 pounds of marijuana, and will lead to the prosecution of 55 alleged smugglers.  That is a remarkable record of success., Fourteen operations went into this offload.  One of them was of a self-propelled, semi-submersible vessel, which resulted in the largest Coast Guard removal in four years., The Coast Guard is seizing illegal drugs at a faster rate than ever before.  And you all have been at the tip of the spear, making that happen., Since October 2016, the Coast Guard has actually seized more than 1.2 million pounds of cocaine.  And already this year, the Coast Guard has seized roughly $3.6 billion in illegal drugs and detained more than 400 alleged smugglers., And make no mistake about it, Coasties: Your courageous service is saving American lives.  Give yourselves a round of applause.  (Applause.)  It’s true.  I mean, think about it: A pound of cocaine is enough for thousands of fatal doses.  And you’ve kept thousands of pounds of cocaine out of our communities, on this mission., Your work is more important to our nation than ever before.  And as we heard moments ago, in the past decade, cocaine has claimed the lives of some 70,000 Americans — sons and daughters, moms and dads, neighbors and friends.  And while we’ve been reeling from the opioid crisis across this country, cocaine deaths doubled nationwide from 2013 to 2016., And transnational criminal organizations are relentless in their efforts to bring cocaine across our borders.  Just last week, CBP made the largest cocaine seizure in the history of Customs and Border Protection.  They seized a ship that was found to have more than a billion dollars’ worth of cocaine on it — on just one ship., And make no mistake about it: These two issues are linked.  The proceeds of cocaine sales are often used to fund opioid trafficking, as well., And so I’m here today, on behalf of the President of the United States and all of the American people to pay a debt of gratitude and respect to each and every one of you and your families who supported you during this deployment.  Because this Cutter is full of patriots.  You’ve already served this nation with distinction., You know, I was on my way here and I read up on the namesake of this ship — the only Coast Guardsman ever to receive Medal of Honor., Munro is a legend not only in the Coast Guard, in our armed forces, but also in the Marine Corps.  And it was just a week ago, Admiral, that I heard the story for the first time — that his life was slipping away from mortal injuries that he suffered when that Coast Guardsman made it possible for Marines to exit the beach in 1943.  His last words were, “Did they get off?”, This is a proud ship with a proud tradition.  And the men and women standing before me today in this deployment have done the name Munro and U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro’s namesake proud.  Well done.  (Applause.), And I know you’re men and women from every walk of life.  You volunteered to be in the Coast Guard.  You’re serving with great distinction — like a guy who has led hull and deck preservation for this cutter, I heard about.  At the same time, he’s also led the deck’s division small boat operations.  I’m told he led pursuits of smugglers up to 40 knots in speed, including one pursuit last month that led to the seizure of 4,000 pounds of contraband., And I’d mention him today even if his birthday wasn’t tomorrow.  Would you all join me in recognizing and thank Petty Officer Derrick Jones?  Where are you?  Job well done, Derrick.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Great job.  And happy birthday., Another Petty Officer who has served the Coast Guard for 16 years I’m told served on two other national security cutters.  And before they came to the Munro, he participated in operations that seized more than 34,000 pounds of contraband, Admiral.  I’m told that he is a true leader and also a proud son of California.  So let’s hear it for Petty Officer John D’Arcy.  Well done, John.  Thanks for a great career of service.  (Applause.)  We’re grateful for you., The American people are grateful not just to these two, but each and every one of you.  It’s why I’m here.  It’s why you stood out here in the sun so long today — just so you’d hear it.  Hear it one more time.  And I want to promise you: You not only have the gratitude of the President and the American people, but I promise you, in President Donald Trump, you have a Commander-in-Chief who will always have your back., And this President has made a priority from the first day of our administration to make sure the men and women of our armed forces have the resources and the support that you need — the best training and the best equipment in the history of warfare., You know, I’m proud to say that in our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in more than 10 years.  And you deserved every single penny., He also signed into law more than $12 billion for the Coast Guard to rebuild aging ships and strengthen your vital assets., As all of you know, when your vessels are operating beyond their planned service lives, it — it can jeopardize the mission, and more importantly, it can jeopardize your safety.  And we’re not going to have it., And the truth is, recently, the mighty Cutter Bear — which I was on, Admiral, just a few months ago — was delayed in departing for a counter-narcotics patrol because of engineering problems.  But we’re setting all that right., Our Coast Guard deserves better.  That’s why we are committed to fully funding our Coast Guard and replacing old ships with new ones, just like the U.S. Cutter Munro.  Get ready.  More help is on the way.  (Applause.), This year we’re celebrating, also, 20 years of HITRON, which has been proven so instrumental in today’s offload and in so many other counterdrug efforts.  This administration understands how effective HITRON is for you.  And the President’s budget for next year, I’m proud to report, has proposed increasing HITRON deployment days by 25 percent., We’ve made incredible progress in strengthening our military and giving all of you the resources to make the fight against the drug crisis over the last two and a half years., But as you know, not all of the battle that we fight is on the seas.  You know, as my fellow Americans, that we have a crisis at our southern border.  But what you all understand, I’m certain — and I want to you know we understand: Every day that our southern border remains unsecured gives criminal syndicates and drug traffickers more opportunity to peddle their poison and spread the violence that’s cut short too many American lives.  That’s why we’re in this fight to end the crisis at our southern border., And the truth is the men and women of the Coast Guard and the DEA know firsthand the transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America — and the drug cartels that fuel their deadly trades — represent one of the greatest national security and public health threats to the American people., These criminal organizations in Central America are also helping to fuel the crisis at our southern border by literally driving thousands of vulnerable families out of their homes to take the long and dangerous journey north., But you in the Coast Guard are taking the fight to those criminal traffickers and attacking our border crisis at its root., For four years in a row, the DEA has told us that Mexican drug cartels “remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.”  And those are tough words., The drugs that they bring across our border cost us lives and billions of dollars in healthcare expenses that result in crime in our streets and tear apart our communities., Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age.  In 2016, across America, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day.  Don’t doubt for a second, as you embark on your next deployment, that the work you’re doing is more important now than ever before.  And what you seize and put on these decks to be offloaded has prevented from tearing apart communities and lives across America., The truth is the illicit drug trade also fuels gang violence.  It provides funding for other crimes, like extortion and human trafficking., And the challenges and threats that you face every day underscore why we remain so determined not just to give the Coast Guard the resources you need to accomplish your mission, but this President and this administration is determined and will not rest until we secure our southern border and we end the crisis at our southern border once and for all., As the President said, it’s a “moral issue,” and we have a moral duty not just to secure our border but “to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.”, We’ve got work to do.  But I promise, my fellow Americans gathered here, we will not rest or relent until we stop the flow of illegal drugs pouring into our country across that southern border., That’s why this President declared a national emergency.  We’ve already begun to build the wall on the southern border., That’s why this President reached a historic agreement with Mexico, securing the most significant commitments from the Mexican government in more than 20 years., And that’s why the President negotiated a bipartisan bill just a few short weeks ago that’s now speeding $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid to support the compassionate work of Customs and Border Protection and Health and Human Services at our border., I’ll be traveling there tomorrow.  I’ll be bringing a delegation of senators.  And we’ll be showing them and the American people, firsthand, that our system is overwhelmed, but the men and women of Customs and Border Protection are providing compassionate care to vulnerable families swept up in this crisis., In the days ahead, I want you to be confident that just as you fight every day to keep our nation safe, this President and this administration will keep fighting for you.  We’re grateful for all you do., The men and women of the Coast Guard are from the rest of us, but you’re the best of us.  You really are.  And on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, allow me to admonish you: In these challenging times, for those who would do harm to our families, take to the Pacific, mind your mission.  On the next deployment, take care of your people, respect the chain of command, never doubt your calling, and never doubt your ability to do your duty.  You wouldn’t be here if you couldn’t., And never doubt that your work is more important than ever before.  Rescuing Americans from the scourge of drug abuse and rescuing those in peril on the seas is an essential calling of the modern United States Coast Guard., So stay on mission and know that, as your work is vital to the security of this nation, be ,  — be always ready., I know the Commander-in-Chief and the American people can count on you just as we have on this last deployment., And never doubt that you have the support of not only this President and his Vice President but of the American people.  You have their admiration.  And when the winds blow and the rains come down, the hurricane gale force strikes, the American people marvel at the Coast Guard.  And I expect when news of today is reported around the country of this incredible offload, they’ll be inspired again by your selflessness, your professionalism, and your patriotism., And never doubt as you sail that you go with their support and ours, and you also go with the prayers of millions who I know will pray always, as they did on this last deployment, for your next.  That as you serve in this great Coast Guard, as you “rise on the wings of the dawn, if you settle on the far side of the sea,” that even there you would know that “His right hand will hold [you] fast.”  And that will be our prayer., So thank you for the honor of addressing you today.  My heartfelt congratulations to the Captain and the outstanding crew of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro on a job well done.  Thank you for your service.  God bless you.  God bless the Coast Guard.  And God continue to bless the United States of America.  Thanks everybody.  (Applause.), END, 12:42 P.M.

PDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, why don’t you start, Kevin?  And this has been a very exciting project, as you know.  It’s — for many years, people have wanted the proper wall and we have a wall that — the likes of which, very few places have ever seen., And I want to thank all of the people.  General Semonite from the Army Corps of Engineers — we’re working very closely with them.  I want to thank Kevin and all of your staff —, ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Thank you, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  — because what they’ve done is beyond., And I wanted to show you some of the details of the wall.  You can see — you can see a pretty good view.  This is going to be close to 500 miles by the time we finish.  Those are the areas that are most important., After we’re completed 5- — that should be done pretty close to next year.  Over — it’ll be over 400 miles.  And we think we can get it close to 500 miles by the end of next year, depending on certain terrain conditions.  But we’re doing all of the most important areas.  We have a lot of natural barriers, like mountains and streams and rivers and — some pretty vicious and violent rivers, actually.  But it’s — it’s an amazing project., And I think what I’d like you to do is if you could explain the interior of these pipes.  The wall is 30 feet high.  We also have 18-foot wall.  We have a combination of 30 feet and 18 [feet], depending on the area, depending on the — on the importance., Tijuana is right over here.  There are thousands of people over there that had been trying to get in.  Tremendous cooperation from Mexico.  And the President of Mexico has been fantastic.  All of Mexico has been fantastic.  As you know, right now they have 27,000 soldiers.  So, in addition to the wall, we have the soldiers., Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we’re building it at a breakneck speed.  I wanted them to show you the interior of parts of the wall and what’s inside of each individual slat.  And you’ll see it’s a combination of steel, concrete, and — as one of the folks just said — it really is virtually impenetrable.  Any walls that were put up would get knocked down very quickly, very easily.  This wall is not something that can be really knocked down.  I guess anything can, but this is very tough., And it goes down six feet.  It’s three and four feet wide.  The concrete — you see it right here; it’s exposed.  And I might ask General Semonite to say a few words about it., And I’d like to bring them right up — look at the inner tube — to see what happens.  Because after the wall is up, we pour concrete, and concrete goes into the tube.  And in addition to that, we have rebar.  So if you think you’re going to cut it with a blowtorch, that doesn’t work because you hit concrete.  And then if you think you’re going to go through the concrete, that doesn’t work because we have very powerful rebar inside., So it’s a very powerful, very powerful wall — the likes of which, probably, to this extent, has not been built before., This is an area — because it’s so highly trafficked, this was one of the most dangerous areas.  We have a double wall.  We have a wall on both sides.  One is 18 feet; that’s your border.  And the other one is 30 feet.  And everybody — if they should be able to make that, this is where people are waiting for them.  It’s a very — a very powerful situation., So, General, maybe you could take over for a couple of minutes, and then I’ll take it back., GENERAL SEMONITE:  So, Mr. President, I want to build on your comments.  This is a system.  It is both the two walls, but it also is the road networks, down through the middle and the back, so that the Customs and Border can go ahead and continue to be able to move around it.  Also, a lighting system., And if you think about this, I mean, it really is kind of a defense in depth.  When you think about these panels going up — right now, we’re putting in about 270 panels a day that are going in the ground.  We’ve got over 44,000 panels that are already built.  And you think about the depth of how we’re doing it., Without getting into a lot of details: 66 miles today are already completed.  There’s 251 miles that are under contract, going in the ground right now at 17 other sites.  There’s 163 miles that are actually on contracts that are going to be (inaudible) in the next 90 days.  And the remainder of the miles the President talked about is mainly private land that takes a little bit longer to get., One of the things I want to just remind you about: That when you have a football field — kind of a flat area like this — it’s a little bit easier to build a wall.  But if you just turn around and look at the mountain behind you, one of the projects that’s going to go up in the next year continues this barrier right up over the rest of that mountain.  So it goes back to being able to — we’ve got to have this linear capability to be able to continue to provide that level of defense., We will talk — this is what the bollards look like.  Thirty feet high on the backside.  And you’ll see, on the inside, there was a time —, THE PRESIDENT:  Come on over here, if you want.  You can bring the cameras.  It’s sort of interesting., GENERAL SEMONITE:  — where people were worried that maybe you could negotiate — you could negotiate through the bollard., So what the bollard is now, again, is that there are two pieces of rebar — 12 feet long — that are inside the bollard.  And then, when we put it up, we put concrete in.  I won’t tell you the depth of the concrete, but it is a pretty substantial obstacle to be able to go through., And I would defer to you, Commissioner, for anything else you want to add., ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Yeah.  Thanks, General.  So a very important part of this — and that’s why the President was talking about the (inaudible).  Right here, what we — part of what the wall gets is, is it gets the men and women of CBP, specifically Border Patrol, operational capacity to get to the area where people are trying to illegally cross., Before — the old landing style — they could cut through that in seconds.  Sometimes, they could come in a vehicle and just knock it over, and literally, within seconds, they were in the United States illegally.  This makes it almost impenetrable., Right now, they’ve had four attempts to cut through this.  All four times it’s failed.  Border Patrol has been able to respond and interdict those individuals., This, right here — this design — it’s a game changer., THE PRESIDENT:  And the reason we pour the concrete afterwards is because it’s too heavy to lift when the concrete is poured in.  So we put it up and we pour the concrete.  A lot of people don’t see that.  But we pour the concrete afterwards., So you have the rebar, you have the steel, and then you have concrete.  And it’s hardened concrete.  Very powerful concrete.  What is that — 4,000 pounds or 5,000-pound concrete?, GENERAL SEMONITE:  That would be 5,000, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s a very strong — that’s a very powerful concrete.  And a lot of technological advances have been made with concrete.  It sounds pretty simple, but it’s not.  It’s a very powerful concrete., So you have the rebar, you have the outer crust, and you have the inside is concrete.  And it’s pretty amazing.  And, again, the concrete is poured after it’s up.  They pour it through funnels and cover much of the territory of the bollard., GENERAL SEMONITE:  Mr. President, also, this is a great view to look at the anti-climb.  I defer to the Commissioner to explain what that panel does., ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Hey, you know what?  I’d actually turn this over right now to our chief patrol agent right now, Agent Harrison.  He’s really going to be able to give you, from an agent’s perspective, exactly the magnitude of what this wall — the operational capacity — gives the Border Patrol agents., AGENT HARRISON:  Thank you, Commissioner and Mr. President.  So, so you know, sir, this is the wall that the agents asked for.  And they wanted me to tell you personally that they appreciate this — and not only this here, but the extension that — it’s bringing the secondary out, further out.  They really appreciate it.  It makes them safer —, THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  You’ve been great.  You guys have been great., AGENT HARRISON:  — it makes the community safer, and it allows us to make that apprehension here in the border zone, as opposed to getting in vehicles and getting in pursuits on the highway.  We want to make that apprehension here., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, just in terms of the quality, I came with the Border Patrol — we worked with them very closely.  I said, “Fellas, how about doing a less expensive version?”  They said, “Well, this is the version that works” — including the poured concrete in the steel, with the rebar and everything else.  That’s the Rolls Royce version., Then I said, “Well, fellas, how about doing one wall instead of two?”  In a lot of areas, we have two — where you have tremendous amounts of people on the other side trying to break through.  We know exactly where those areas are — Tijuana being over here, as I said.  And they said, “Well, sir, two works much better in these areas.”  A lot more expensive.  So, we have the one side, on the border — 18 [feet].  And then we have over here, 30 feet., And I think one of the things you were asking, Mark, and wanted somebody to explain is the protection on top — how that stops.  It’s an anti-climb device, if you look at the steel on top.  It’s also structural, but actually it was there, more importantly, for anti-climb., Do you want to explain that?  The panels up top., AGENT HARRISON:  So it’s one thing to figure out how to navigate the vertical posts, but the transition at the top makes the climb orders of magnitude more difficult.  It requires different equipment, different tools, different skills.  And so it’s the change, as we get to the top, that adds to the protection of that fence, sir., ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  And, again, anything that we can do to give the Border Patrol agent even a few more seconds, a few more minutes to respond — that’s a game changer., And, sir, if you don’t mind, I think this is important to talk about.  The chief patrol agent just mentioned — is that there’s a false narrative out there that this wall is the President’s vanity wall.  I’m here to tell you right now that’s false.  This President, this administration — what they did is exactly what the President just explained.  He reached out to the experts — to the Border Patrol agents that are on the frontlines every single day, risking their lives protecting this country, enforcing the laws that Congress enacted.  He reached out to those agents, to those line agents, and asked, “What do you need to do your job more effectively to secure and safeguard this country?”  And those Border Patrol agents said, “We need this.”, \\nSo, this President — thank you.  You listened to the agents and you gave them exactly what they asked for., THE PRESIDENT:  This is your maximum that you can do.  And one thing we haven’t mentioned is technology.  They’re wired so that we will know if somebody is trying to break through.  And you may want to discuss that a little bit, General., GENERAL SEMONITE:  Sir, there could be some merit in not discussing that., THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  (Laughter.)  I like that.  That was a great answer.  I’ll just tell you they’re wired, okay?  They’re wired.  They’re, technologically, very advanced.  All set up for cameras any place we want.  We have all of the — everything we need.  But it’s all set up for cameras, for anything.  And you’ve been hearing “drone technology” — they’re all wired out for drone technology.  Anything you want, we have., And, frankly, this is the right time to do it.  Because to do it later, after it’s built is very expensive.  This way, it’s mostly just adding wire.  So we’re all set up to adapt., And that’s the story.  We have certain areas like this, where you have double walls.  If you look behind, you can see how it goes up the hill.  And that goes many miles in that direction.  And we’re starting now many miles in this direction., We also have — it all fits together like a puzzle.  How many sites would you say, over the next period of time, will have been started construction?, GENERAL SEMONITE:  Sir, probably about 35 sites.  At any one given point, all working — and some of the contractors, actually — if they’re building five miles, they might having one on one end, one on the other, and one in the middle, so they get the maximum amount of people building at the same time., THE PRESIDENT:  So we have different bids and different contractors.  This is one contractor — an excellent contractor, by the way.  They’re doing a really good job.  But we have many contractors bidding on many different parts in different states — in Arizona; New Mexico, where I just left.  We have great contractors bidding, and we’re starting walls in New Mexico.  The Arizona wall are moving along really well.  They’re really moving along rapidly, and they need them desperately., And part of the beauty — sometimes you’ll see the tunneling, where they go under the wall.  Here, this goes down — the concrete goes down very deep.  It’s very hard to tunnel.  You can’t tunnel.  It’s actually dangerous.  But, at a certain point, you hit rock, so you can’t tunnel.  So we have it covered underground.  We have it covered over ground., \\nAnd this is — as I said, this is the finest you can do.  I said, “Let’s do it differently.  We don’t have to go 30 feet.”  They said, “Sir, if you don’t do 30 feet, it won’t be the same, because of the climb.”, We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers.  We got climbers.  We had 20 mountain climbers.  That’s all they do; they love to climb mountains.  They can have it.  Me, I don’t want to climb mountains.  But they’re very good.  And some of them were champions.  And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb., And we’ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back — a lot of drugs.  I mean, they’re unbelievable climbers.  This wall can’t be climbed.  This is very, very hard., And what the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it’s also very hard to get by panel.  Plus, it’s designed to absorb heat, so it’s extremely hot.  The wall is — you won’t be able to touch it.  You can — you can fry an egg on that wall.  It’s very, very hot., So if they’re going to climb it, they’re going to have bring hoses and waters — water.  And we don’t’ know where they’re going to hook it up, because there’s not a lot of water out here.  So it’s a very, very hard thing to climb., We were thinking about an all-concrete wall — this is a much more expensive version — but they want to be able to have a vision in through — looking through Mexico, looking in both directions.  They have to be able to because otherwise you have a block; you can’t see what’s going on on the other side.  They can build — literally, they could have a group of some pretty tough people out there.  And we don’t want to do that., You may want to explain that.  Why would you want — you need this vision.  It was so important.  Because, frankly, an all-concrete wall would have been a much less expensive wall to build.  But from the standpoint of Border Patrol, they were very much opposed to it., Go ahead., AGENT HARRISON:  So, sir, as you mentioned, it — our agents patrol along these walls., THE PRESIDENT:  Right., AGENT HARRISON:  And as they get closer to that, being able to see the threat through the wall prior to a rock coming over the fence or something else coming over the fence at them is just — it’s an officer-safety thing, sir.  And we appreciate it., THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Yeah.  It worked out.  And I understood., It’s sort of interesting; I always envisioned maybe it’s a solid concrete wall.  And that would have been easy to do.  But every time I had a meeting with Border Patrol, with ICE, with the General, with the — everybody involved — with Kevin, with Mark, they said, “Sir, we have to be able to see through.  If you don’t see through, this thing is not going to work.  It’s not going to be a good situation.”, They even talk about things where somebody would be talking on one side of the wall and they would throw up bags of drugs that weigh 100 pounds.  They would catapult it up and over the wall.  And it was — I mean, we’ve had instances where people got hit on the other side because you don’t see who’s over there.  So having the wall, though it’s more expensive, but it’s the right thing to do., And people that have seen it — other countries are now coming, as you know, and they’re studying the wall, because other people are thinking about something.  The only thing is, I’m not sure that they can afford a wall like this.  This is —, Q    Which countries?, THE PRESIDENT:  This is really — I will tell you at a certain point if I get their approval.  We’ve had three of them already.  They’re coming and they’re studying the wall.  But I’ll let you know.  If I can get their approval, I’ll give that., Who asked that?  Jeff?, Q    That was me., THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll give you that information if I can.  I want to ask their approval first, okay?, So that’s pretty much it.  Again, the President of Mexico has been great.  The soldiers who are right outside — we have a lot of soldiers right now — they’ve been great.  Twenty-seven thousand, I think, is the number, as of today., And this will be something very special.  I want to thank Mark.  And I want to thank Kevin.  And I want to thank you.  Really fantastic job they’ve done.  The whole — the whole group.  Border Patrol has been incredible.  And the knowledge that you’ve imparted — who would think this is what we had to do?  But that’s it., When you look down here, you’ll see on a more flat area — this is fairly flat — you’ll see what the wall looks like, and it’s pretty impressive., If the cameras can look down here — and these are the real people.  These are the workers that put up the wall, by the way.  All of these guys, they don’t do as much of that.  (Laughter.)  But these guys do a great job, but we appreciate it, fellas.  These are the ones that are here., Each one of these is considered a panel.  When they said — how many panels are you going to put up?, GENERAL SEMONITE:  Over 44,000 are in right now, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  Forty-four thousand are already in.  Each one of these — if you look they’re — they’re together.  So each one of these, I think, they have — so they would have — yeah — like eight?  Eight., ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Yes sir., THE PRESIDENT:  Eight bollards., ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Right., THE PRESIDENT:  And each one of them — so I guess it’s mostly an eight bollard.  We also have some very sophisticated openings when you have to get the Border Patrol through or various people through to the other side.  We have some really beautiful openings that work, I hear, really well.  I hear we finally figured that one out, right?, That’s — that was not an easy thing to figure out because of the weight.  The weight is — it’s tremendously heavy., But if you look down here, you’ll see what the wall looks like.  And the beautiful thing is that people are seeing that we’re not going to do — in another week, I understand — no more catch and release.  We’re not allowing people into the country at all anymore.  Nobody is coming in unless they’re coming in legally.  They’re coming in through a process., We have it covered between 27,000 Mexican soldiers.  And, really, now the wall is starting to kick in very big.  San Diego was just — they were just thanking me for the wall we built in San Diego.  It’s like — they said it’s a difference of day and night.  They actually said, “It’s 100 percent.”, The only thing is we have to now expand it out.  The only way they get through to walk many, many miles in the opposite direction — one way or the other — and go around it.  But going over it is impossible — is virtually impossible.  But they were very, very happy with what we’ve done., So the days — and I tell you this very strongly: No more people can come in.  We wanted Congress to help us.  It would have made life very easy.  And we still want them to get rid of loopholes, but we’ve done it a different way.  We’ve done it with the help of Mexico.  We’ve done it with the help of Border Patrol.  And we’ve done it with the help of Kevin and all of your great people, and Mark.  We’ve done it a different way., We still want them to do it because it would be a little bit easier, but Congress wouldn’t do it.  When I say “Congress” — the Democrats just wouldn’t do it.  So now we have a world-class security system at the border, including the highest technology.  I would think that there’s no place like this anywhere.  There’s no place has anything like this or even close to it., Now, other places have guards and, unfortunately, they have machine guns and they have electrified fences.  You touch them and you get electrocuted.  We don’t do that.  We don’t do that.  But this is something that is equally difficult to get across., Okay?, Q    Can you explain what was here before?  Was there fencing here?  Was there anything here?, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  We had a very low fencing here.  In fact, you were here before, I think.  We had a very low fencing.  It was a — like a sheet metal.  And people would knock it over, like just routinely.  And we ripped it out., We have a lot of areas where we had that and even less than that, and then we have areas where we had nothing.  We had some areas where we just had a pipe along the ground and that, sort of, stopped cars or trucks, but they’d knock that out pretty quickly., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[East Room, 12:55 P.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student. Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed — did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor., And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer has just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, “Never Trump.” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that., I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time — we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that., And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we’ll do some questions — unless you have no questions. That’s always a possibility., I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we’ve done., A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it — let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that’s good. Now it means that’s good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them., I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay too., Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control., I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure, we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not — the distortion. And we’ll talk about it, and you’ll be able to ask me questions about it., But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places — low-pay, low-wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea — we’ll take care of it, folks. We’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess., Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many., We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom — and meetings — Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka., I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis — he’s over there now, working very hard — to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer. Another mess I inherited., And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism. And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now. It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody., I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I’ve had great support from the Senate. I’ve had great support from Congress generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it, I talked about it at every stop. Depleted — it’s depleted. It won’t be depleted for long., And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength., At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders. They’re so surprised — “oh, you’re having strong borders.” Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else., One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lie to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians., I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before. So that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan., In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason. But a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there., I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos! Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval., So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me., Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals — bilateral. We’re going to have one-on-one deals., We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit — it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process — they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense — and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection. It’s not going to take years. But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries., We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they’re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing., We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer., We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we’re going to have a wall that works. We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke., We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are — release. We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many., We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters safe — and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are. I can tell you that., Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I’ve heard 80 percent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that and we are going further., We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part., We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new “Buy American” measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen. We want them to use American steel. And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea. We put it in., To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It’s a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare — I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing. So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. We’re bringing our jobs back to this country big league. It’s already happening, but big league., I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson — he’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people., Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade — not free — fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do., Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know — you were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here., Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we’re naming., Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades and decades and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen., And one more thing. I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes., This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week., So we’re just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions., Mara. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference., Q Did you fire Mike Flynn?, THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who — there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given., He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — they know nothing about it. They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news., The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara — and I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call. All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place., The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed., Yes, go ahead., Q Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?, THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to be — and he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He’s doing the job., You know, he was just doing his job. The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision., But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me., Yes., Q President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was — it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story — I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part — I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him, ever. And he thought it was a joke., The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia — but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s, by the way — who’s, by the way, a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody. But everybody — people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories., So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders — almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that’s the extent., Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there — because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA. James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one. And he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in., And just while you’re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday. And it talked about — you saw it, front page. So, Director of National Intelligence just put out — acting — a statement: “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” — this was just given to us — “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.”, So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal — top — and they just wrote the story is not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest — because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me — front page. Big massive story. And it was nasty., And then they called. They said, “We never said that. We like Mr. Trump.” They called up my office — we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you — totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And, frankly, I then went on to other things., Go ahead., Q Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT: You okay?, Q I am. Just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008., THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m talking about Republican. Yes., Q President Obama, 332. George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told — I was given that information. I don’t know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin., Q I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you’re providing information that’s fake?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don’t know. I was given that information. I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?, Q You’re the President., THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you. That’s a good answer. Yes., Q Mr. President, thank you so much. Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn — there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?, And further than that, sir, you’ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks., THE PRESIDENT: We are., Q Can we ask what you’re doing to do? And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position. So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own., As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came — Don McGahn, White House Counsel — and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong. He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don’t see — to me, he was doing the job., The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job., So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man., Yes, Jon., Q On the leaks, sir —, THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon., Q Sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today —, THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies. I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act., You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen. But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine. I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important. But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?, So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I’m dealing with Mexico. I’m dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We’ve got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty., Yes, Jon., Q Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said — you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake., So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters. It’s very important to me, and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true. And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that. But I’m not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no. It’s okay, Jim. It’s okay, Jim. You’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly., But I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better., People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter, is that one right? Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress., But honestly, the public would appreciate it. I’d appreciate it. Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for., And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that’s okay. That’s fine., But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it., Yeah, go ahead, Jim., Q The first part of my question on contacts. Do you definitively say that nobody —, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 2:19 P.M. EDT, MS. SANDERS:  Slow news day?  Quiet crowd?  Good afternoon.  To mark the last day of Made in America Week, this afternoon the President will welcome several living survivors of the attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor and their families., Other events this week have focused mainly on the products and goods bearing that highly esteemed Made in America label., But truly the most prized thing to have come out of our country have been the brave men and women who have risked their lives protecting the freedom of Americans and our allies around the globe., And just a few minutes ago at two o’clock, the President signed an executive order that will ensure the men and women of the greatest military in the world have the ships, aircraft, vehicles, and other supplies they will need to keep us safe in the years ahead., This order commissions the first-ever, whole-government assessment of America’s defense industrial base, marking the first time since President Eisenhower that an American President is investing personal attention into the health of the United States defense industrial base., President Trump is committed to maintaining the secure supply chains and robust workforce that will support our nation’s heroes for decades to come., Next week, we’ll be highlighting American heroes like the World War Two veterans, the first responders who keep our communities safe every day, and the boys and girls who will grow up to be the next generation of American leaders., While I’m on the topic of the men and women who protect us, I also wanted to note that the President commended the House yesterday for voting to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security for the first time., The Homeland Security Authorization Act also authorizes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the first time.  Secretary Kelly has already made tremendous progress in fulfilling the President’s promise to end illegal immigration and fully enforce the laws of the United States, and this bill reflects the President’s strong commitment to ensuring that progress continues., Also on the Hill, of course, Senate Republicans this week continued to work toward our shared goal of saving the American people from the disaster of Obamacare., Earlier this afternoon, Vice President Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price hosted representatives from several grassroots organizations calling on the Senate to take action on healthcare legislation., As the President has said, inaction is simply not an option.  These groups want lawmakers to know that their members want them to follow through on their promise to the American people., Finally I’d like to read a statement from the President on the resignation of Press Secretary Sean Spicer:, “I am grateful for Sean’s work on behalf of my administration and the American people.  I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities:  Just look at his great television ratings.”, Sean will continue to serve the administration through August., And the President has also appointed Anthony Scaramucci as Communications Director and I have statement on Anthony’s appointment as well:, “Anthony is a person I have great respect for, and he will be an important addition to this administration.  He has been a great supporter and will now help implement key aspects of our agenda while leading the communications team.  We have accomplished so much, and we are being given credit for so little.  The good news is the people get it, even if the media doesn’t.”, And I’d like to bring Anthony up to say a few words and take a few questions.  As always I’ll be back after that to answer any follow-up questions., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Thank you, Sarah.  Thank you very much., So I’m going to be very brief.  I’m going to make my remarks informal and then I’ll take questions from everybody., First off, I’d like to announce formally that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to the press —, Q    We can’t hear., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Oh, you can’t hear me?  I’m sorry.  Better?  Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to be the press secretary, and so you can congratulate her after the — you still can’t hear me?  No sound?  Better?  Better now?, I’m going to start over.  (Laughter.)  You guys heard me in the front, though, right?  What did I say, John?  Sarah is going to be the press secretary right?, Q    Press secretary.  Congratulations., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Okay, so congratulations to you, Sarah.  (Applause.), And so I want to make a couple of statements.  The first thing I want to say is I want to thank personally Sean Spicer not only behalf of myself, the President, the administration, but Sean is a true American patriot.  He’s a military serviceman.  He’s got a great family, and he’s done an amazing job., This is obviously a difficult situation to be in, and I applaud his efforts here, and I love the guy, and I wish him well, and I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money., As it relates to me in this position, I’m going to spend a couple of weeks getting to know the people here, and I’m going to be as coordinated as I can with the people inside the West Wing., There’s been some speculation in the press about me and Reince so I just want to talk about that very quickly.  Reince and I have been personal friends for six years.  We are a little bit like brothers where we rough each other up once in a while, which is totally normal for brothers.  There’s a lot of people in here who have brothers, and so you get that.  But he’s a dear friend.  He brought me into the political system.  He brought me into the Republican National Committee network.  He introduced me to Governor Walker.  We’ve spent many times together socially.  A lot of people are not aware about this, but after the Romney campaign, I invited Reince into SkyBridge.  I think it reflects poorly on Reince that he didn’t take my offer to come in and be our chief operating officer, but I say that in jest obviously., And so what I want you guys to know is that he was my first call this morning.  I met with him before we sat in the Oval Office, and we are committed as true professionals to the team and the process of getting the administration’s message out.  I think that is going to be one of the big goals for us., I said during the transition, and I’ll say it up here, I think there has been at times a disconnect between the way we see the President and how much we love the President, and the way some of you perhaps see the President.  I certainly see the American people probably see the President the way I do, but we want to get that message out there.  And to use a Wall Street expression, there might be an arbitrage spread between how well we are doing and how well some of you guys think we’re doing, and we’re going to work hard to close that spread., And so I’m done.  I’ll take your questions.  Yes.  I’ll —, Q    Yes, two questions for you, Anthony —, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  — as many people as I can until she hooks me., Q    Sure.  Two questions for you.  Number one, what we have seen from this administration so far is the President being his own messenger very frequently, and that has caused, as you know, some struggles for the communications staff.  How do you expect to get this White House back on track?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I’m going to take a slight issue with the question because I actually think the White House is on track, and we’re actually I think doing a really good job., Q    From a messaging perspective?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I actually do think from a messaging perspective because we have a whole list of things.  And I didn’t want to come out here with our list of accomplishments and start a whole advertisement infomercial right now.  I really just wanted to talk about personnel movement and how we’re thinking about things.  But I think we’re doing an amazing job., The President himself is always going to be the President.  I was in the Oval Office with him earlier today, and we were talking about letting him be himself, letting him express his full identity.  I think he’s got some of the best political instincts in the world and perhaps in history.  When you think about it he started his political ascent two years and two months ago, and he’s done a phenomenal job for the American people., And the people I grew up with, they so identify with the President, and they love him.  And so we’re going to get that message out., \\nQ    And my second question to you —, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  I’m going to get to everybody.  Don’t worry., Q    If you can speak a little bit about how you plan to — obviously, you’re a business guy; you’re a Wall Street guy — how you plan to handle any potential conflicts of interest and walk us through how this offer was made to you, what the President said when you were here, what the conversations were like?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I don’t think it’s fair to the President for me to go into the exact conversation because I want to keep those conversations between me and him private.  But we talked a little bit about the White House.  We talked a little bit about our personal relationship.  And then when he extended the offer to me, I said, I would do it because I want to serve the President., One of the things — I have a lot of family members that served in the American military.  Unfortunately, my generation — I’m born in 1964, I did not serve.  I filled out the Selective Service.  It’s one of the regrets for my life, so this is an opportunity for me to serve the country., I love the President.  I obviously love the country.  Look at my life experience here in the country, and so it’s an honor to be here.  It’s an honor to stand here actually., Q    And on the conflicts?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  In terms of my personal business conflicts?, Q    Correct, yes., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, so I have worked with the Office of Government Ethics to take care of all of my business conflicts.  My start date is going to be in a couple of weeks so that it’s 100 percent totally cleansed and clean.  And I don’t see an issue with it.  The Office of Government Ethics doesn’t see an issue with it, nor does the White House Counsel., But here’s one thing I want to say about this, though, when you’re bringing American business people into the administration and they’ve had some level of success in this society, they have to unencumber themselves.  And it’s just a very interesting thing, and it’s somewhat ironic.  You want to go serve the country, and so the first thing you have to do is take on this mega-opportunity cost by getting rid of all your assets.  But I’m willing to do that because I love the country., John., Q    Anthony, you’ve been watching this White House from somewhat outside, and I’m sure you have your own perspective on what you’ve seen., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Not quite as candid as you, though.  Not that outside., Q    Not quite.  What is the first thing you’re going to change to try to right this ship and put it on course?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Again, I take issue with that.  I think this ship is going to go — the ship is going in the right direction.  I think we’ve got to just radio signal the direction very, very clearly.  I like the team.  Let me rephrase that:  I love the team., And so I’m an incrementalist.  Most entrepreneurs you will find are incrementalists.  To say something overly bold or overly dramatic is unfair.  What good entrepreneurs do is they start the day and they go through the process.  The Navy SEALs will tell you that if you want to eat an elephant, you got to eat it one bite at a time.  And Sarah and I are going to do that together., Q    Anthony, did you have any hesitation taking this job knowing it might cause some friction and that it might lead to Sean leaving, which is what’s going to happen?  And the two are at least somewhat coincidental.  And did you have any hesitation about how you would relate to the rest of the White House staff if you came in under those circumstances?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, listen, remember I’m a business person.  And so what happens in business a lot of the times is you have some rotation in personnel as you’re making changes, and you have lifestyle choices that people are also making., I would love to have Sean here.  Sean decided that he thought it would be better to go.  And for me, as it relates to Sean, it speaks volumes to who he is as a human being, who he is as a team player, okay?, So his attitude is, if Anthony is coming in, let me clear the slate for Anthony.  And I do appreciate that about Sean, and I love him for it.  But I don’t have any friction with Sean.  I don’t have any friction with Reince.  This is the White House of the United States of America, and we’re serving the President.  And I want to make sure that our cultural template is that we put the President’s agenda first, which is perfect for the American people, and we serve his interests., And so if we have a little bit of friction inside the White House as a result of that, it’s okay.  We can all live with that.  I’m a business person.  I’m used to dealing with friction., Q    You were a significant player during the transition.  Was it disappointing that you did not land a post here from the get-go?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Again, I would say as an entrepreneur you have to be accustomed to setbacks.  I’ve had a series of setbacks in my life, which I’ve written about.  I wrote a best-selling book — and if you don’t believe me, you can come into my basement, I’ll show you every copy in order to get to be a best-selling book.  (Laughter.)  And so I’m very honest about mistakes that I’ve made and setbacks that I’ve had.  And so was I disappointed?  Yes.  I said that candidly that I was disappointed.  But I love the President, and I’m very, very loyal to the President.  And I love the mission that the President has, okay?  Since the early days of the campaign when I went to these rallies and I saw the love that the people had for the President, and I grew up in the middle class, and so there’s a struggle out there.  The President saw that before I did.  I wish I could tell you I saw it before him, but he taught it to me.  And I feel that struggle and have empathy for that struggle, and I want to be here to help him make things better for the American people., So I’ll talk into this.  Yes, sir.  I’m going to try to get to everybody.  I promise you I’ll try to get to everybody., Q    Sean told the AP and others that the President needed a clean slate.  How does that comport with a White House that’s headed in the right direction?  And secondly, how badly does the President need a win on healthcare in order to make progress?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Look, so here’s one problem with the way our society is working.  Right now we are micromanaging the seconds of the news cycle.  I predict that the President will get a win in healthcare.  That’s my honest prediction just because I’ve seen him in operation over the last 20-plus years.  The President has really good karma, okay?  And the world turns back to him.  He’s genuinely a wonderful human being, and I think as the members of Congress get to know him better and get comfortable with him, they’re going to let him lead them to the right things for the American people.  So I think we’re going to get the healthcare done., I also think we’re going to get tax reform done.  And whatever else is on the President’s agenda, we’re going to work very, very hard, very studiously here to make it happen., Jon., Q    So I see the cameras are back.  Will you commit now to holding regular on-camera briefings, Sarah?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  If she supplies hair and makeup, I will consider it, okay?  (Laughter.)  But I need a lot of hair and makeup, Jon.  I don’t know.  Maybe., Q    You’re going to be doing the briefing?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Not at all.  This is the press secretary.  I’m up here today only because I think it’s the first day.  We made a mutual decision that it would make sense for me to come up here and try to answer as many questions as possible.  And the answer is, we may.  I have to talk to the President about it.  I like consulting with the President before I make decisions like that., Go ahead, Jon.  Keep going., Q    And I know you’ve been one of the President’s strongest supporters for a while now.  But does he know what you said about him back in 2015, when you said he was a hack politician?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, he brings it up — he brings it up every 15 seconds, all right?  (Laughter.)  One of the biggest mistakes that I made because I was an unexperienced person in the world of politics; I was supporting another candidate; I should have never said that about him.  So, Mr. President, if you’re listening, I personally apologize for the 50th time for saying that., But here’s the wonderful thing about the news media:  That was three minutes of my life.  He’s never forgotten it, and you’ve never forgotten it.  But I hope that someday, Mr. President, you will forget it., Let’s go to the next question., Q    Can I ask you one more?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Go head, Jon., Q    There’s been a question about credibility, some things that have been said in this room.  Let me ask you a variation of what I asked Sean Spicer on his first day:  Is it your commitment to the best of your ability give accurate information, the truth from that podium?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  I sort of feel like I don’t even have to answer that question.  I hope you can feel that from me, just from my body language, that’s the kind of person I am.  I’m going to do the best I can., I’m going to get to everybody.  Go ahead., Q    Anthony, you mentioned your relationship with Reince.  Was he involved in offering you this position?  Was he consulted by the President ahead of time?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, he was consulted.  He was involved in the thing.  There’s a lot of speculation in the press about the timing and so on and so forth.  And so what I’m here to tell you is that we’re a team., Now if you —, Q    Can you walk us through how the job was offered?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Like I said, I think some of this stuff, it’s unnecessary to go into that granular detail because then — it’s almost like the book, The Circle, where you’re wearing like a police camera on you when you’re having conversations.  I don’t think that’s fair the President., But here’s what I tell you, okay?  I’m a team player.  I’ve played team sports my whole life — at least as a kid, and I believe that you have to subordinate yourself to the greater good of the team.  And if teammates don’t have disagreements about certain things, then they’re not going to get to the championship.  You got to get together and mix it up a little bit from time to time., I have no problem mixing it up with these guys.  I love these guys.  I respect these guys.  Is it perfect every single day?  Tell me whose life is perfect every single day., But here’s the commitment that I’m making to you and to the American people and to the President that I’m here to serve him, and I’m here to serve the people inside the West Wing., Q    Just a follow-up on Jon’s question, are you committed then to regular televised briefings and having a transparent relationship with the press?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Again, I obviously am committed to being transparent because I’m standing here.  But I’d like to talk that over with the President, and we’ve got a new press secretary.  I’d like to talk it over with her.  And then we’ll get back to you on that., But listen, I’m standing right here.  I’m going to try to answer every question., Sara, go ahead., Q    So two quick questions, the first one, obviously we know the President has been feeling under siege with the Russia investigations both at the Department of Justice but also on the Hill.  Do you feel like he was feeling exposed?  He didn’t have people adequately coming to his defense, is that part of the reason that we have you here today in the White House?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  I don’t think so.  So one of the things that I’m doing today is I sort of didn’t have my White House Counsel briefing before I’m having a press briefing, so I’m want to limit my remarks related to the Russia situation and things like that., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:36 P.M. EST, MR. SPICER: Hey, guys. I brought a guest. Good afternoon. First off, at the top, I want to acknowledge that there’s been an additional wave of threats to Jewish community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices. According to some reports, there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions since the start of this year alone., As the President said at the beginning of his joint address, “We’re a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms. We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms.”, It is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you, and I share the President’s thoughts that he fervently hopes that we don’t continue to have to share these reports with you. But as long as they will — as long as they do continue, we’ll continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop them., Now, on to news of the day. You saw President Trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises: protecting the country against radical Islamic terrorism, and repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative., We talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the United States yesterday. And so, on to Obamacare. I’d like to introduce the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare., Dr. Price., SECRETARY PRICE: Thanks, Sean. Good afternoon. First, let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I’m the third physician out of 23 individuals who’ve had the privilege of serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And we take that mission very, very seriously., And for many Americans, right now, their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge. For most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It’s about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won’t be a penalty for not purchasing coverage. For the folks in the Medicare system, there will be no changes at all in the current law. But we’re talking about those people in the individual and small-group market, the moms and pops, the folks who run the corner grocery store, the corner cleaners. Those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverage., And then Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care, and we want to make certain that we address that., This is about patients. This is not about money. This is not about something else. This is about patients. And sadly, the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and small-group market. The access is going down, and it’s only getting worse. You know the stories. Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year, on average. Arizona had an increase of 116 percent. Deductibles are going up for many, many folks. If you’re a mom or a dad out there and you make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, your deductible in this market, in that individual and small-group market, oftentimes is $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 a year., What that means is you’ve got an insurance card but you don’t get care because you can’t afford the deductible. And we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the care., A third of the counties in the United States — one-third of the counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. One insurer is not a choice. So we need to make certain that we correct that., In Tennessee this morning, it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Insurers are leaving the market on the exchange. Last year there were 232 insurers that were providing coverage — that were offering coverage on the exchange; now there are 167. That’s a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone. And all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they need., Now, the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability, we want a system that’s affordable for everybody. Accessibility, we need a system that’s accessible for everybody. A system that’s of the highest quality, a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system, and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountability., The President spoke last week, last Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, and he laid out his principles. First, wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market. Nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosis., In terms of affordability, health savings accounts — growing choices for patients is incredibly important. Tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, not that the government forces them to buy. We’ve always talked about — in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place, that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage., Those, again, in the employer-sponsored market, they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage. Those folks that are out there in the individual and small-group market, no tax benefit. And that’s what this plan would do., State flexibility. It’s incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is, have the flexibility, especially in the Medicaid program, to be able to respond to their vulnerable population., Lawsuit abuse. The President mentioned, and it’s incredibly important, that — the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year, and we need to make certain that we’re addressing that as well. The President also talked about a glide path, an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country, and that’s important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks., Buying across state lines, buying insurance across state lines. The President talked about this on the campaign over and over. The American people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines, and it increases competition. And we need to make certain that that happens, and then addressing the incredible increase in drug prices., There are three phases of this plan. One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives. That’s the start of all of this. Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place. As you all well know, the previous administration used regulations to a fare-thee-well — in fact, there were 192 specific rules that were put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5,000 letters of guidance and the like. And we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients, then we need to continue them. If they harm patients or increase costs, then obviously they need to be addressed. And then there’s other legislation that will need to be addressed that can’t be done through the reconciliation process., So the goal of all of this is patient-centered healthcare, where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions, and not the federal government. We commend the House for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process., And I look forward to a few questions. Yes, sir., Q Mr. Secretary, you’re familiar from your time in the House with the clout that conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action have with rank-and-file members. What does it say about this legislation that these groups are already out with opposition to it?, SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the beginning of the process. And we look forward to working with them and others to make certain that, again, we come up with that process that aligns with the principles that we’ve defined that they actually adhere to or agree with as well, and that is that we need a system that’s affordable for folks, a system that’s accessible for individuals, that’s of the highest quality, that incentivizes innovation, and that empowers patients., And so we look forward to working with them through this process., Q Secretary, Congressman Chaffetz said today that Americans may need to forgo a new iPhone to pay for healthcare, and they’ll have to kind of make these choices. Does the administration agree with that? Will Americans under this plan — will they need to maybe sacrifice other goods to pay for their healthcare?, SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important question, because what’s happening right now is that the American people are having to sacrifice in order to purchase coverage. And, as I mentioned, many individuals can’t afford the kind of coverage that they have right now. So they’ve got that insurance card but they don’t have care., What our desire is, is to drive down the healthcare costs for everybody. And the way that you do that is to increase choices for folks, increase competition, return the regulation of healthcare where it ought to be, which is at the state level, not at the federal level. All of these things that, taken in their aggregate, will in fact decrease the costs of healthcare and health coverage, and that will allow folks to be able to purchase the coverage that they want., Yes, sir., Q Thank you, Dr. Price. I have two questions for you. First has to do with guarantees that you can make as the administration’s point person on this legislation. Can you guarantee that whatever legislation emerges and makes it to the President’s desk will allow individuals, if they like their doctor they can keep their doctor? And the second guarantee is, can you also guarantee that healthcare premiums for individuals will come down with this new legislation?, SECRETARY PRICE: Again, a remarkably important question because, as you’ll recall, the promise from the last administration was if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your plan you can keep your plan. Both of those promises turned out to be not true., We think it’s incredibly important for the American people to be able to select the physician and the place where they’re treated themselves, that the government ought not be involved in that process. And so our goal is absolutely to make certain that individuals have the opportunity to select their physician., In terms of premiums, we believe strongly that through this whole process and as it takes effect, that we’ll see a decrease in not only the premiums that individuals will see, but a decrease in the cost of healthcare for folks. Remember, that was another promise that the previous administration made, that you’d see a decrease in $2,500 on average for families across this land; in fact, what they’ve seen is an increase of $2,500 or $3,000., So we’re going to go in the other direction. We’re going to go in a direction that empowers patients and holds down costs., Yes., Q Mr. Secretary, you are quite a distance away from conservatives with this plan in the central part of it, which is tax credits, which they see as yet another entitlement, very similar to the entitlement of Obamacare but different in form. How do you convince them, since it’s going to take tax credits to make this work, that they need to swallow this and move forward with the bill? I mean, you’re getting an awful lot of opposition on the central tenet of this whole thing., SECRETARY PRICE: This is all about patients. And in order to provide that transition and in order to make it so that nobody falls through the cracks. We’ve got to have a system that allows for individuals to gain the kind of coverage that they want., And we, conservatives and others, have said for a long, long time that we believe it’s important to equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing coverage, gaining coverage through their employer, and those not. And the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to equalize that tax treatment. Folks have talked about this for many, many years, actually, so that there’s not a distortion in the tax code for who’s able to gain a benefit for being able to purchase coverage and not., Q Sir, Mr. Secretary, you were talking about making sure people don’t fall through the cracks. The last administration, with Obamacare, focused in on making sure the underserved were part of the equation. What is the safety net or the safeguard that you have to make sure — to ensure people don’t fall through the cracks beyond the tax incentives, but also for the underserved, who are now part of — many are now part of the program that weren’t before, prior to Obamacare., SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this is extremely important as well. And the current system, as you likely know, for those vulnerable in our population, especially in the Medicaid population, this is a system that’s broken. You’ve got a third of the physicians in this country — one-third of the doctors in this country that would be eligible to see Medicaid patients who aren’t seeing Medicaid patients right now. And it’s not because they’ve forgotten how to take care of patients, it’s because of the rules that are in place that make it too onerous or too difficult for them to see Medicaid patients., So we believe that it’s important to allow states to have that flexibility to fashion the program for their vulnerable population that actually responds to that population in a way that gives them the authority, them the choices, them the opportunity to gain coverage and the care that they believe most appropriate., Q What if you find out that that is not happening when you give it to the states? Is there some type of punishment or some type of piece that you’re going to put in place to make sure that that happens, that they follow through on your intent?, SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, absolutely. There’s accountability throughout the plan that we have that would allow for the Secretary and the Department to be certain that the individuals that we believe need to be cared for are being cared for in the state at the appropriate level. But we believe this is a partnership. This is about patients and partnership., The previous administration tended to make it about government. We believe it’s about patients and partnership, and we want to partner with every single person in this land who wants to make certain that we allow the kind of choices and quality to exist., Q The President tweeted earlier today. He described this bill as “our wonderful new healthcare bill.” There’s been a little bit of confusion. Does this represent the administration’s bill? And is there anything in this bill that the administration cannot support?, SECRETARY PRICE: This has been a work in progress. As you know, this has been going on for over a year. The work that I had the privilege of participating in when I served in the House of Representatives in the last Congress was open and transparent and we invited folks in to give their ideas. And tens, if not hundreds, of people had input into that process., This grew out of that, and over the past number of weeks, we’ve been having conversations with folks on the Hill, in the House and in the Senate, and other stakeholders. And so this is a work product that is a result of all of that process. The President and the administration support this step in the right — what we believe is in the right direction, a step that repeals Obamacare and gets us moving in the direction of those principles that I outlined., Q Do you support everything that’s in that bill that’s sitting on the table, sir? Do you support everything that’s in the bill sitting on the table, sir?, SECRETARY PRICE: This is a work in progress and we’ll work with the House and the Senate in this process. As you know, it’s a legislative process that occurs. I’m glad you pointed out the bill is on the table there. As you’ll see, this bill right here was the bill that was introduced in 2009 and ’10 by the previous administration. Notice how thick that is. Some of you will recall that I actually turned the pages and went through that piece of legislation in a YouTube. The pile on the right is the current bill., And what it means is that we are making certain that the process, that the decisions that are going to be made are not going to be made by the federal government. They’re going to be made by patients and families and doctors., One last —, Q Mr. Secretary, given the opposition that John and others have brought up here today, does this plan already need to be salvaged in your view? And how do you do it?, SECRETARY PRICE: Oh, no. You know what happens with these things. You start at a starting point, people engage and they get involved in the process, sometimes to a greater degree. Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that’s currently on the table and that has a — as a work in progress — or in process. And we’ll work through it., Q So this is a starting point here?, SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important process to be had. The American people have said to their elected leaders that the Obamacare process for them gaining coverage and care is not working. That’s what they’ve said. And so we believe it’s important to respond to the American people and provide a healthcare system that allows for them to purchase the kind of coverage and care that they desire., Yes., Q You said in your letter to the House chairman that necessary technical and appropriate changes might need to be made for this bill to reach the President’s desk. So what specific changes is the White House and the administration looking for in this bill?, SECRETARY PRICE: Well, as I mentioned, there are three different phases to this process. One is this bill, this legislation that’s working through under the rules of reconciliation, which is a fancy term to mean that there are only certain things that you can do from a budgetary standpoint has to affect either spending or revenue. There are things that you can’t do in this bill, and those we plan on doing across the horizon in phase two, which is the regulatory portion, and then in phase three, which is another piece of legislation that would be going through the House and the Senate with a majority — supermajority in the Senate., That process will incorporate all of the kinds of things that we believe are absolutely necessary to reconstitute that individual and small-group market and to get us in a position, again, where patients and families and docs are making these decisions., Q Mr. Secretary, bearing in mind that the CBO score isn’t back yet, can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on deficit or result in millions of Americans losing health insurance?, SECRETARY PRICE: What I can say is that the goal and the desire I know of the individuals on the Hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal government., Q Mr. Secretary, two elements of the bill. I have questions about how they control costs and how they help with access. The Medicaid per-capita block grant through the states, how is that sort of fundamentally different from the Obamacare regime on Medicaid in terms of expanding access?, And then the second point, why doesn’t this bill do away with the cost-sharing community ratings regime that Obamacare had?, SECRETARY PRICE: So the per-capita cap, Medicaid, again, is a system that doesn’t work for patients. You’ve got folks out there who need care, who need to see particular physicians who aren’t able to see them. All Americans should be saddened by the situation that we have when there are patients out there that can’t get the care that they need. We believe one of the keys to providing appropriate care in the Medicaid population is allowing the states to have the flexibility to address that Medicaid population., Remember, Medicaid population is four different demographic groups. It’s those who are disabled, it’s those who are seniors, it’s healthy moms and kids, by and large. Those are the four main demographic groups. And we, the federal government, force states, mostly, to take care of those individuals in exactly the same way. If you describe that to the folks back home on Main Street, they say, that doesn’t make any sense at all. You need a program that’s different for the healthy moms and kids to respond to their needs that’s different than folks who are disabled and seniors., And so what we believe is appropriate is to say to the states, you know your population best. You know best how to care for your vulnerable population. We’re going to watch you and make certain that you do so, but you know how to do that. And that will decrease costs markedly in the Medicaid program. We’re wasting significant amounts of money — not that folks are getting too much care, we’re wasting it because it’s inefficient and there’s significant abuse in the system., So in terms of the cost-sharing, I think that the cost-sharing measures are being addressed. It’s important that we run through that process. This is the process where we felt the previous administration was spending money that they didn’t have the authority to spend, and Congress is working through that to make certain that the rightful holders of the authority to spend money in this nation, which is the Congress of the United States, exercises that authority., Q How does the White House and you feel about the label “Trumpcare”?, SECRETARY PRICE: I’ll let others provide a description for it. I prefer to call it patient care. This is about patients at the end of the day. This isn’t about politicians. This isn’t about insurance companies. This is about patients. And patients in this nation, especially those in the individual and small-group market, these are the folks., I had the privilege of going to Cincinnati last week with the Vice President to a small-business roundtable. And one of the business owners, one of the small-business owners there, said he had 18 employees last year at this time. This year, he has 15 employees — not because he doesn’t have the work, but because of the cost of health coverage for those individuals forced him — forced him — to let three people go., Now, they’re being forced to let three people go because the federal government has put in place rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for folks in the individual and small-group market to provide coverage for their employees. This is a system that’s not working for people. So if we focus on the patients — I’ll call it patient care. If you focus on the patients, we’ll get to the right answer., Q Mr. Secretary, a major complaint — sorry — a major complaint of conservatives with phase one of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that it is missing a measure that would allow healthcare to be sold across state lines. Now, the President said this morning that that would be in either phase two or phase three. Is that something that you believe the President could do through executive action, and then you yourself could do? Or is that something that you believe has to be addressed legislatively?, SECRETARY PRICE: There are different aspects to the purchase across state lines that will allow individuals to gain, again, the kind of choices that they want. Some of this might be able to be done from a regulatory or a rules standpoint. Some of it will require legislation, and that’s where we’re going to need the assistance of our friends on the other side of the aisle., The American people have demanded that they be able to purchase coverage across state lines, purchase coverage that they want for themselves. So whether it’s through association health plans, which allows individuals who are in small-business groups, like the fellow that I just mentioned, to pool together nationally to be able to purchase coverage, or whether it’s mom and dad, who don’t gain coverage through their employer through something called individual health pools that allows folks to pool together solely for the purpose of purchasing coverage, even though they’re not otherwise economically aligned. That allows people — there are 18 million folks in that individual and small-group market. That would allow those individuals to be able to purchase coverage and get the purchasing power of millions. That’s huge power and authority that we want to put in the hands of people, that we want to put in the hands of patients. And some of that may, in fact, require legislation., Yes, sir., Q Mr. Secretary, thank you. Two questions but first, Congressman John Faso of New York has said that the issue of denying federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be separate from whatever healthcare bill finally emerges from Congress and is signed into law by the President. Is that the administration’s position as well?, And my second question is this. You mentioned earlier the people who had their healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they could keep it. I believe in your state of Georgia, more than a million people had that experience. Will some of the plans that were cancelled be able to come back under the new healthcare plan?, SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, in terms of Planned Parenthood, we think it’s important that the legislature work its will on this process. It’s incredibly important that we not violate anybody’s conscience. We want to protect the conscience provisions that exist. It’s also important to appreciate that through community health centers, the bill that’s being proposed right now would allow greater access for women to healthcare in greater numbers of facilities across this land. And they’ve actually proposed more money for women’s healthcare than currently exists. So I think that they’re working their best to address that issue., In terms of whether or not old plans that were available before might be available, absolutely. And we believe that the opportunity to provide a robust market, robust choices for individuals across this land will be secured. And, again, that’s one of the keys to bringing down the premium costs, of bringing down the cost for health coverage. So we’re excited about that and look forward to that coming to pass., Q If the new plan calls for repealing the revenue-generating taxes and penalties but keeping the entitlements, how is that sustainable?, SECRETARY PRICE: That’s the work that somebody mentioned over here — the Congressional Budget Office score, and once the Congress receives that score, then they’ll be working through that to make certain that in fact it is fiscally responsible., Imagine, if you would, however, a system where the incentives within the system are all to drive down costs, to provide greater choices and competition for folks, and respond to the specific needs of patients. And in so doing, what you do is actually get a much more efficient system for the provision and the delivery of healthcare. It’s a system we don’t have right now because the previous administration felt that the government — the federal government ought to do all of this. And we’ve seen what came about when the federal government does all of that — that it’s increasing premiums, increasing deductibles, decreasing choices. You’ve got a card that says you’ve got insurance, and you walk in, and you can’t afford what it is that’s trying to — for the doctor that’s trying to take care of you., So this is not a system that’s working for folks in that individual and small-group market and in the exchanges., Q Mr. Secretary, many have complained that Obamacare resulted in higher wait times in the emergency room. Will this new bill cause that? Have you have any idea on that?, SECRETARY PRICE: One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of healthcare, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite. And much of that is because of, again, the rules and the regulations that they put in place., So from our perspective, we believe that if individuals are able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, then they’ll have access to the kind of doctors and other providers that they desire, and won’t need to be able to be seen in the emergency room. They’ll already have the care. Emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies, not for the standard care that individuals tend to receive right now., So we believe that if you put in place the right system, then emergency rooms and emergency physicians will be able to have the opportunity to care for those individuals that appropriately present to their department., Q Mr. Secretary, I’m interested in following up on your comment that it’s important that no one vote on anything that violates their conscience. Federal funding already can’t be used for abortions, but are you saying that the administration has a position on provision of birth control at these community health centers? And secondly, is the administration looking to actively withhold funding to Planned Parenthood if they continue to provide abortions, as has been reported?, SECRETARY PRICE: We’re working through all of those issues. As you know, many of those were through the rule-making process and we’re working through that. So that’s not a part of this piece of legislation right here., Q But you don’t have a view on provision of birth control and access to it? When you’re talking about women’s healthcare, which you brought up, and saying you wanted to expand more community funding., SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, what we’re doing, as I say, is working through the rules and the regulations to see where the previous administration was, see how they did it, and whether or not it needs to be addressed. With the understanding that what we believe is important when we look at the rules and regulations is to define whether or not that rule or regulation actually helps patients and decreases costs, or harms patients and increases costs. If it does the latter, then we need to do away it. If it does the former, then we ought to accentuate it., Q What was the issue of conscience you were talking about? What was the issue of conscience you were talking about then?, SECRETARY PRICE: To make certain that individuals in the market are not forced to do things that violate their conscience., Yes, sir., Q Secretary, thank you, sir. Common people and the small businesses have been waiting for this new bill under President Trump. So any message, sir, for them?, SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the culmination of years of work. It’s the culmination of years of concern and frustration by the American people. They knew at the time that the previous bill — the previous law passed that it wasn’t going to help them. They knew that costs were going to go up. In fact, we predicted at the time that costs would go up and that access would go down. And so this is the culmination of years of hard work by the electorate, by the citizens of this country to say that we want a system, again, that respects patients and families and doctors in these decisions., One more., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Loews Atlanta Hotel, \\nAtlanta, Georgia, 4:46 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Georgia! (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. Thank you for those great words. Thank you for your great leadership here in Georgia. It is great to be back in the Peach State. (Applause.), In fact, last Saturday, my family and I actually celebrated St. Paddy’s Day in the great city of Savannah, Georgia. (Applause.) And today, I’m honored to be here in Atlanta, with the men and women who helped elect a President and leaders in Congress who, just three months ago yesterday, enacted historic tax cuts to put America first. You did it, Georgia. (Applause.), And, in fact, let me begin today by bringing greetings from a friend of mine. When I left the Oval Office today, I could tell he was just a little bit jealous about where I was headed. And he wanted me to tell all of you that he loves Georgia. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We love Georgia., And I’m here today to talk about the progress that we’ve all made together over the past year. But before I get started, let me take a moment to acknowledge that Georgia lost one of its greatest leaders today — Zell Miller., Zell was a leader of great character and great integrity. He dedicated his life to public service and to serving this country. He was a United States Marine, a governor, a United States senator. And the difference he made in the life of this great state and the life of this nation will impact this country for generations to come., Zell Miller was a great champion of public education, and, as governor, he helped establish the HOPE Scholarship that opened so many doors of opportunity for students across this state., And above all, Zell was a proud Georgian, and he always put the interests of the hardworking men and women of Georgia first, even when it wasn’t popular within his own political party. He remains an inspiration not just to the people of Georgia, but to leaders all across this country, on this day., So let me say our prayers are with his family and all those who love, and cherish, and admire this great man. And I know I speak for all of Georgia when I say that Zell Miller will be missed. He was a great Georgian. He was a great American. And we will long remember the life and legacy and contributions of Zell Miller. (Applause.) Thank you for that., And to Governor Deal, thank you for that wonderful introduction and for your lifetime of leadership and service to the great state of Georgia. (Applause.) I actually had the chance to get to know your governor when we both served in Congress together., But his two terms as governor have left the Peach State stronger, and safer, and more prosperous than ever before in the history of this state. Seven-hundred thousand new jobs in seven years is an incredible record. Would you all mind getting on your feet and showing the 82nd governor of the great state of Georgia and his wonderful wife, Sandra, just how much we appreciate their leadership and the difference that they’ve made in Georgia. (Applause.), And with us today are also three other friends of mine, and great friends of our President, leaders in the House of Representatives who work every day to put Georgia first and to put America first: Representatives Karen Handel, Rob Woodall, and Barry Loudermilk. (Applause.) Where are you?, I also want to recognize a special guest you just heard from a few minutes ago. I gave him a ride here. (Laughter.) He is a great champion of American workers and of freedom in the marketplace. He’s working tirelessly to unleash American energy at the EPA. Join me in thanking our EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt one more time. He is a great, great leader. (Applause.), And finally — finally, I’d like to thank the host of today’s event who brought us all together, an organization that’s fighting to promote the policies that are making a real difference — a real difference in the life of the state of Georgia and our entire nation. Join me in thanking America First Policies for bringing us all together on a Friday afternoon. (Applause.), You know, I’m here in the Peach State today, first and foremost, just to say thank you. Thank you, Georgia. Thank you for everything you’ve done to stand with our administration, not only in that election in 2016, but in every day since. Because of your support and your hard work, it’s been a year of action; it’s been a year of results. In a word, it’s been a year of promises made and promises kept. (Applause.), Even earlier today, in the spending bill the President signed into law, we saw the promises of this administration kept, one after another. As the President made clear, under this bill, the government, unfortunately, is still too big and still spends too much., Now, the bill wasn’t perfect, but you all deserve to know it is chock-full of examples of how this President fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of Georgia and to the American people. And it all begins with providing for the common defense. National defense is now the top priority — (applause) — of this country and this administration., You know, President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy. And just a few hours ago, I was standing nearby when President Donald Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense in American history. (Applause.), The President promised to increase take-home pay for men and women who wear the uniform of the United States –- and he did just that. The largest pay increase for our armed forces in nearly 10 years signed into law today. (Applause.), You know, and today, I can tell from where I’m standing that we’re joined by an awful lot of heroes in this room. In fact, there’s a group of heroes from Dobbins Air Reserve Base and Robins Air Force Base here in Georgia, who serve in the United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Would you all just mind showing these men and women in uniform how much we appreciate them stepping up to defend our nation? (Applause.), You know, and it isn’t just those on active duty the President promised to support; he also promised to support America’s veterans. And I’m pleased to report to you, in the bill that he just signed — (applause) — we gave the Department of Veterans Affairs the resources they need to completely eliminate the backlog for veterans once and for all. (Applause.) And we are going to make sure our veterans get the support and the healthcare in real time that they earned in the uniform of the United States., Our President also promised to protect our homeland and secure our borders. As I stand before you today, I’m pleased to report that in a little more than a year, illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut nearly in half. And with the $1.6 billion of funding in the bill just signed into law, the United States will immediately begin construction of nearly 100 miles of a new border wall. (Applause.) And let me make you a promise: When it comes to the wall, we’re going to build it all. (Applause.), You know, the President also promised to appoint strong conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And this President not only appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States, but he also set a record of the most court of appeal judges confirmed in a single year in American history, and they’re all conservative men and women that are going to make you proud. (Applause.), President Trump also promised to stand with America’s men and women in law enforcement. And I promise you today, with resources in this legislation and with respect, we once again are giving the men and women who wear the uniform of law enforcement and public safety the resources and respect they deserve. (Applause.), So it’s about strength abroad, strength on our borders, but it’s also about safety and security here at home in our neighborhoods, our homes, and our schools, where it matters most., All of our hearts are still broken in the wake of the terrible shootings that have beset communities in recent days, and claimed innocent lives. You know, our President promised, in the wake of the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that this time America would take action because no child should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever fear for the safety of their child when they drop them off at school in the morning., And I’m pleased to report to you that the legislation signed today includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, it bolsters and improves our criminal background check system, and gives parents and schools new tools and new resources to keep our kids safe. (Applause.), President Trump also promised to do more than any administration to combat a crisis that’s impacting families here in Georgia and all across this country — the scourge of opiate abuse and addiction. Unfortunately, no community, large or small, that hasn’t been impacted., And the legislation just signed today will actually invest a record amount, more than any time in history — $6 billion to end this epidemic. And as President Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire earlier this week, “We will make this the generation that ends the scourge of opiate addiction in America.” (Applause.), He promised to rebuild America. And I’m also happy to report to you, in the bill just signed — the Governor will be happy about this, too — we’ve got another $21 billion to rebuild our infrastructure. And that includes $50 million for that expansion project at the Port of Savannah, which is so critical to the growth and prosperity of this state of Georgia. (Applause.), Now, as the President said today, this bill is far from perfect. I mean, the truth is, the processes we have in Congress these days don’t allow for perfection. In fact, the President said today, it’s “no way to run a government.” (Laughter.), That’s why President Trump is calling on Congress, starting today, to give this President the same authority that 44 governors have all across this country. The time has come to give the President of the United States of America the line-item veto, so the President can fund the priorities of the American people and protect American taxpayers at the same time. (Applause.), So since day one of this administration, we’ve been working hard to keep the promises that we made to the people of Georgia. And when you look at the record, over the last 14 months, it has been a record of promises made and promises kept. And it’s so humbling for me to be a part of it., Now, when you talk about all that we’ve done together — I came here today to really talk about what’s happening in this economy. I mean, from early in this administration, we’ve been working with these great members of Congress to roll back the heavy hand of government on businesses large and small., In fact, I remember back on the campaign trail, and maybe some of you do too, the President promised that he would repeal two federal regulations for every one new federal rule put on the books. The truth is, we didn’t do that. With the support of our leaders in Congress, and the majorities in the House and the Senate, we’ve repealed 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the federal book. It’s true. (Applause.) In fact, President Trump has signed more laws, rolling back federal red tape already than any President in American history. (Applause.), \\nWe promised to provide the American people relief from the disaster known as Obamacare. You know, today is actually the 8th anniversary of that failed law. And I’m happy to report to you that, last December, the President signed legislation to repeal the Obamacare individual mandate. It’s gone. It’s off the books. (Applause.), We promised to unleash American energy. And this President, from early on, approved the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. We rolled back the Clean Power Plan. And as you just heard Scott Pruitt say, President Trump put America first when he withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.), We promised to crack down on unfair — we promised to crack down on unfair trade practices, as well. The President has taken decisive action to protect our steel and aluminum and forestry industries. And I’ll make you a promise: Under President Donald Trump, the era of economic surrender is over. (Applause.) We are going to demand our trading partners give us fair and free and reciprocal trade that puts American workers first., And finally, what brought us all here today on a Friday afternoon, taking a break from watching basketball — (laughter) — is that this President promised to cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses and family farms. And three months ago yesterday, with the strong support of these great leaders in the Congress, and with the support of every Georgia Republican in the House of Representatives, President Donald Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. That’s promises made and promises kept. (Applause.), You know, we’re just over a year into our administration and the results are nothing short of remarkable. Because of your support, because of the leadership that you supported — from the Oval Office to Capitol Hill to the State House here in Georgia — since our election, American businesses have created nearly 3 million new jobs, including 40,000 new jobs in the Atlanta area alone. And unemployment in America hasn’t been this low in 17 years., In February alone, the American economy actually created 313,000 new jobs in a single month. It was the best month for construction and manufacturing in 20 years. (Applause.) In fact, the only sector of the economy to lose jobs in the month of February was the federal government. (Applause.), I mean, here in the Peach State, thanks to the actions of our administration and the strong support of your representatives in Congress, and thanks to seven years of Governor Nathan Deal’s leadership, Georgia’s economy is booming as never before., For five years running, Georgia has been ranked the best state in America to do business. And today, 17 Fortune 500 companies call Georgia home. (Applause.) And since our inauguration, unemployment in the Atlanta area has fallen by nearly 20 percent. And when it comes to the good-paying jobs that make Georgia great, since Election Day 2016, businesses across this state have created over 23,000 new jobs in manufacturing and construction., You know what? You look around Georgia; you look around America. Because of the leadership that you’ve supported, growth is back; confidence is back. In a word, America is back with President Donald Trump in the White House. (Applause.) It’s exciting., But as the President likes to say, at this White House, that’s just what we call a good start. (Laughter.) Because the truth is, we believe the best days for American prosperity are yet to come because these tax cuts are just starting to make a difference., I mean, think about it. I mean, we cut taxes for Georgia’s working families so you could keep more of your hard-earned money. We cut taxes for Georgia’s businesses so they can compete and win with companies anywhere around the world. We cut taxes for Georgia’s farmers, too. And all of those tax cuts are only now actually beginning to take effect in the economy. So for everything that we’re seeing happening, men and women of Georgia, it’s only just begun., You know, earlier this week, on National Agriculture Day, I was over at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And there’s a great champion for rural America — you might have heard from him — a guy by the name of Sonny Perdue, who is now the Secretary of Agriculture for the United States of America. (Applause.), I mean, the truth is, in this White House, we know that agriculture is the essence of America. That’s why, working with your leaders in Congress, with all the tax cuts that we passed, we also essentially eliminated the death tax for nearly every American farmer. And now farmers can deduct up to 100 percent of the cost of new equipment for the next five years. (Applause.) That’s an affirmation of how important agriculture is to the American economy., You know, all told, when you put it all together in a pile, we believe our tax cuts are going to save the typical family of four here in Georgia more than $2,200 a year when they all take effect., But it’s not just about lower taxes, remember that. It’s also bigger paychecks. It’s about bigger paychecks that come from businesses investing in American jobs and in American workers., In fact, we believe workers in Georgia can expect to see pay raises of more than $4,000 in the years ahead when these tax cuts all take effect., And we’re already on the way. You know, in just the past three months, businesses large and small across this state have already announced plans to pay their workers more, to hand out bonuses, to provide better benefits for more than 75,000 Georgia workers, including bonuses here in Atlanta as high as $2,000 a person., Folks, that’s great news for working families. I mean, a thousand-dollar bonus in the pocket of a working family makes a real difference. But not everybody thinks that. (Laughter.), I mean, you might have heard that the woman that wants to be Speaker of the House again, Nancy Pelosi, said a thousand-dollar bonus at the end of the year was just “crumbs.” Did you hear that term?, Now, I would like to remind you, humbly, I come from the Joseph A. Bank wing of the West Wing of the White House. (Laughter.) You with me on that? (Laughter.) Okay, good., When our kids were little — when our kids were little, and Karen was at home with the kids, I mean, we had a term for an extra thousand dollars in our paycheck at the end of the year: Christmas. (Applause.) Am I right?, I mean, these bonuses and pay raises are making a real difference in the lives of America’s working families. And I want to say very seriously: Any leader who says $1,000 in the pockets of working families is “crumbs” is out of touch with the American people. (Applause.), So let me just take a moment for the people that have been making that difference, supporting the President — your leaders in Congress who stood with the President for these tax cuts and so much more of what we’re talking about here today., I want to thank your two great senators -– Senator Johnny Isakson and Senator David Perdue — for their strong, conservative leadership in the United States Senate. (Applause.), And you’ve already heard from three extraordinary members of Georgia’s delegation in the House of Representatives –- Karen Handel, Rob Woodall, and Barry Loudermilk. They are remarkable people, and I’m just so grateful for their support. (Applause.), But, you know, I’m happy to report they might be the only ones here, but they’re not alone among Georgia’s Republicans. I’m pleased to report to all of you gathered here today that this agenda that we’re celebrating, the accomplishments that we’ve been able to bring about — I’m pleased to report to you that every single Republican in the Georgia delegation to Congress voted for the tax cuts and voted to put Georgia and America first. (Applause.) Every step of the way, they were with us., But, you know, for all that we’ve accomplished, the truth is, we still have more work to do. And in case you didn’t notice, first off, remember that Georgia elected a builder to be President of the United States, and this President is going to rebuild America’s roads and bridges and infrastructure and ports, and give us the best infrastructure in the world. (Applause.), This year, we’re also going to keep working to fix a broken immigration system that puts the best interests of American workers and American families first. (Applause.), We’re going to continue to do everything — we’re going to do everything in our power to confront the scourge of opiate addiction in this country. I promise each and every one of you that. And we’re going to work our hearts out., We’re working on developing non-addictive painkillers to cut opiate prescriptions. The goal is to cut opiate prescriptions by one-third over the next three years so we can prevent Americans from even becoming addicted in the first place., And we’re going to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, first and foremost, by working to reduce the availability of them. And secondly, we’re going to crack down. We’re going to crack down on drug dealers, we’re going to crack down on sanctuary cities. We’re going to secure our border. And we’re going to get tougher on people that are selling drugs to our kids. (Applause.), And, as the President said, that toughness — “that toughness includes the death penalty.” And our administration is going to be working — (applause) — every opportunity the law allows to bring the maximum penalty against those who profit by the drug trade., As the President said on Monday, and I say to all of you, “Failure is not an option. Addiction is not our future.” And we’re going to do whatever it takes, as I said before, to make this the generation that ends the opiate crisis in America., Folks, President Trump and I are just going to keep on delivering. We’re going to keep on delivering on the promises that we made to the good people of Georgia, with your support and with your help., But the President and I know that, for all the progress that we have made, it’s really not a reflection so much of what happens in the marbled halls of Washington, D.C.; that we both know that the strength of this country is found in the hearts, and the character, and the work ethic, and the patriotism of the American people., I mean, America is coming back. The resilience of America is now obvious not just to our fellow citizens, but to the wider world, because the American people are shining forth. By letting people keep more of what they earn, by getting the government out of the way, by making the right investments in ways that support a growing America, America is standing tall again. You see that resilience., And, of course, you have seen that same resilience in the history of this storied city of Atlanta, Georgia. It’s amazing to think just a few miles from here stands a monument that literally captures the essence of this city’s history -– “Atlanta from the Ashes.”, It shows a phoenix rising from the ashes, as you all well now, because that’s exactly what Atlanta had done over the past century and a half. This city was destroyed over 150 years ago, but that wasn’t the end of its history; it was just the beginning of a new history. And because of the resilience of your people and the determination, and the vision, and the faith of the people of Atlanta, this city has risen to become not one of the leading cities of the South, not one of the leading cities of America — this is one of the most dynamic cities in the world. (Applause.), The country looks on in Atlanta — it really does — and watches with inspiration that spirit that has defined this great city over the last century and a half. But no matter what challenges you face, Atlanta continues to reach greater heights every day. And the country is proud, and I know Georgia is proud., That’s the Atlanta spirit for you. It’s evident in every part of this city, and I see it — I see it from where I’m standing in this room today., But as I close today, I encourage you to take that spirit from this gathering, and talk about what you’ve heard here today. And I appreciate you coming out today on a Friday afternoon — a beautiful Friday here in Georgia. It was a lot colder where I left. (Laughter.) And it was a lot colder up in New Hampshire., But I want you to leave here today and I hope you’ll stay involved, stay engaged. Everything that we’ve accomplished, we’ve accomplished because of all of you. I really — I didn’t come here today — and I know these members of Congress feel the same way — to point to Washington and what they’ve done. But I came here today to talk about what you’ve done. Because of the President you elected, because of the leaders in the Congress that you’ve elected, because of the agenda that you supported, this country is coming back — coming back stronger and safer and more prosperous than ever before. And we’re just, really, getting started., So leave here today, and I just encourage you to go out and tell the story to your friends, your loved ones, and your neighbors. I mean, tell them what they’re not hearing on most of their cable television stations about all the good things that are happening in America. Tell them what we’ve accomplished. Say, “You know what? I ran into Mike the other day” — (laughter) — “and he was talking about all this stuff that’s happened in this country, all the things that we’ve accomplished together as Americans to revive and restore this nation, and to restore American credibility and strength on the world’s stage.”, And say, “I just wanted to tell you about it. And tell you about the difference that it’s making in the life of our city, and our state, and our nation.” I mean, go out there and tell them — tell them we cut their taxes so they can keep more of what they earn. Tell them that we’re restoring American strength at home and abroad, so their families can sleep safe at night. Tell them that we’re putting America back to work for them, not the other way around. And tell them that under President Donald Trump, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. Get out there and tell them. (Applause.) Tell them, Georgia. Because it’s true. You tell them., And I think Election Day surprised a few people. (Laughter and applause). And we’ve been surprising them ever since, haven’t we? (Applause.) Because Americans have been talking to each other. People have been seeing these results. They’ve been seeing commonsense, conservative principles put into practice that have put America first., So I just encourage you to stay engaged and to keep telling your neighbors and friends all the good things that are happening here and how the leadership in Georgia and the leadership you’re sending to Washington and the leadership of their President is making a difference in their lives., And, if you’re of a mind, in these challenging times where it seems like there’s too much division in these United States of America, I’d encourage you to maybe do one more thing. You know, there’s an old verse that Americans have clung to throughout our nation’s history, and it’s been true for millennia, and I still believe it’s true today. It says, if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll hear from heaven, and He’ll heal their land. (Applause.) And I truly believe that if we pray for America, that God will heal this one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Applause.) So pray for America. And pray for all who’s serving each and every day., So thanks for being here today. Thank you for the opportunity to address you. I look forward to saying hello to as many of you as can linger afterwards. And I leave here today with renewed confidence — I really do — that with the continued support of the good people of Georgia, with the continued great leadership that your state has, people like Governor Nathan Deal, with these great Georgian leaders in the Congress of the United States fighting for you every day, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I know in my heart we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase — (laughter) — we will make America great again., Thank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless Georgia. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.), END 5:20 P.M. EDT]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:39 P.M. EDT, SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Welcome back.  Today, the President and First Lady welcome President Emmanuel Macron and Mrs. Macron to the White House, beginning the first state visit for the Trump administration.  This visit will celebrate the long and enduring friendship between France and the U.S.  Discussions will include economic, diplomatic, and global issues., The First Lady has taken an active role in every detail and planning of the visit, including the state dinner, which will be held tomorrow evening.  And we’re looking forward to a very successful state visit., As you all saw, we now have three Democrat senators who have announced they will vote to confirm Mike Pompeo, President Trump’s highly qualified nominee for Secretary of State.  However, a majority of Democrats continue their pointless obstruction to score cheap political points with their base as a willful attempt to undermine American diplomacy., Regardless, the President is looking forward to Mike Pompeo’s confirmation so he can continue doing an incredible job on behalf of the American people., I also want to commend the heroic actions of James Shaw Jr. early Sunday morning at a Waffle House in Tennessee.  Mr. Shaw saved lives when he wrestled a gun from an active shooter who had opened fire.  The President offers his condolences to the victims and their families.  He is monitoring the ongoing situation and the White House is in regular contact with state and local officials., Finally, I want to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their third child, a baby boy.  And from one mother to another, I know the reality of being outnumbered can be very scary, but I know she and Prince William will continue to be amazing parents.  So congratulations to them., And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Jonathan., Q    Sarah, on North Korea: Is the President willing to accept anything short of complete denuclearization before lifting any sanctions?, SANDERS:  Certainly the goal is denuclearization of the Peninsula, and we’re going to continue the maximum pressure campaign that has been ongoing to North Korea until we see concrete actions taken towards complete and total denuclearization., Q    But does that mean no sanctions lifted until that’s achieved?  Are you willing to go incrementally?, SANDERS:  Certainly no sanctions lifted until we see concrete actions taken by North Korea to denuclearize, Q    When the President said in his tweet that they had agreed to denuclearize, where did they do that?  Have they already agreed to do that?, SANDERS:  Certainly in a number of the conversations, including the comments, I’d refer you back to also South Korean President Moon, who has said that North Korea has expressed a will for complete denuclearization.  And certainly that’s the focus of any conversation and negotiation that the United States will have with North Korea., Steve., Q    Sarah, to what extent will the Iran nuclear deal come up in the conversation between the President and President Macron?  And what does President Trump want to hear from Macron on this thing?, SANDERS:  Look, I’m not going to get ahead of any conversations that we expect to take place over the next couple of days.  As you know, they just landed a few minutes ago, and haven’t even arrived here at the White House.  I’m not going to presume what those conversations will look like.  We certainly expect that that will be part of the conversation, and we’ll keep you posted if we have any specific details to put out about that., Q    And is the President still leaning towards decertifying the deal when it comes up again on May 12th?, SANDERS:  I don’t have any announcements on that front, but the President has been extremely clear that he thinks it’s a bad deal.  That certainly has not changed., Jim., Q    Wanted to ask you a question, sort of following up on what you were asked this morning about Michael Cohen.  It was noticed by some that you didn’t close the door one way or the other on the President pardoning Michael Cohen.  What is your read on that right now?, SANDERS:  It’s hard to close a door on something that hasn’t taken place.  I don’t like to discuss or comment on hypothetical situations that may or may not ever happen.  I would refer you to personal attorneys to comment on anything specific regarding that case, but we don’t have anything at this point., Q    And can I just ask you about a tweet that the President put out last week?  He tweeted a lot over the weekend.  But last week, he said — he was talking about sanctuary cities in California and saying, “There is a Revolution going on in California.  Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested &amp; breeding concept.”, We haven’t had a chance to ask you about that tweet.  When he used the word “breeding,” was he making a derogatory term about Latinos in California — that they breed a lot or that they’re prone to breeding?  Was he talking about —, SANDERS:  No, he’s talking about the problem itself growing and getting bigger., Q    What does that mean though?, SANDERS:  Sorry, I’ve answered a couple., Justin, go ahead., Q    I also wanted to follow up on a couple of the President’s tweets.  The first was earlier this morning.  I’m wondering if you could explain the President’s tweet that he had ordered DHS not to allow large caravans of individuals into the country.  So if you can say both what specifically he ordered DHS to do, and what that would mean for individuals claiming refugee status within the United States., SANDERS:  Look, the President continues to monitor the ongoing situation.  A sovereign nation that cannot defend its borders will no longer be a sovereign nation.  The Trump administration is committed to enforcing our immigration laws, whether people are part of the caravan or not.  If you enter the United States illegally, let me be clear — you’ve broken the law, and we will enforce the law through prosecution of illegal borders., While we are committed to doing everything we can on the border to secure our nation, we need Congress to do their job as well, and to pass legislation to close the legal loopholes and prevent us from securing our borders and protecting Americans., Q    And then in the other tweet that the President did over the weekend, he said that he didn’t see Michael Cohen flipping to get out of trouble with the government.  I guess that prompts two questions.  The first is, what the President believes his personal attorney might have done to get him in trouble with the government.  And secondly, what the President has done that he is worried Michael Cohen could flip about., SANDERS:  The President has been clear that he hasn’t done anything wrong.  I think we’ve stated that about a thousand times.  Beyond that, I don’t have anything to add beyond the President’s tweet., Matthew., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  There have been a number of documented cases in the press recently of EPA Administrator Pruitt at least appearing to be dishonest about requesting raises for aides, about his relationship with a lobbyist who had business before the EPA (inaudible).  Is the White House concerned at all about this pattern?  And is there concern about him testifying before Congress on Thursday, as scheduled, where these issues are probably going to come up?, SANDERS:  We’re continuing to review a number of the reports that you mentioned, and we’ll let you know if we have any changes on that front., Ashley., Q    Sarah, President Macron is hoping that a proposed side deal between the U.S. and European powers could strengthen the Iran deal enough that President Trump would feel comfortable staying in it.  So is that sort of a fool’s errand?  And the President has said it’s a bad deal.  Does he believe there’s anything that could be done to fix it in a way he’d be comfortable with?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of any potential conversations that are going to take place over the next couple of days.  But as the administration has policy announcements, we’ll be sure to share them with you., Mara., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Just to go back to Jonathan’s question about North Korea, the President tweeted pretty flatly, “…they have agreed to denuclearization.”  And then, you’re saying that they just agreed to talk about it.  What is the President’s definition of complete denuclearization?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to negotiate with you guys.  I’m going to leave that to the President and Kim Jong-un to walk through what some of those details would look like when that meeting takes place.  But I can be very clear that we expect it not to just be mentioned in words, but there have to be concrete actions that take place towards total denuclearization of the Peninsula., Q    Does that mean removing all nukes — our nukes and theirs?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get into the negotiations of what will take place and what the agreement will look like.  But there have to be concrete actions that stop the denuclearization of the Peninsula., Q    Sarah, President Macron appears to have a very robust agenda coming to Washington.  He wants to change the President’s mind on a lot of different things — on the Iran nuclear deal, on keeping U.S. troops in Syria, on tariffs, and maybe even on the Paris Climate Accord.  Does he have an open mind?  Is it possible that he will change his mind after President Macron gets through with him?, SANDERS:  I think that I feel very confident that we have the best negotiator at the table.  Look, you have two leaders that have an incredibly good —, Q    So there’s a great negotiator and not-such-a-great negotiator., SANDERS:  Hold on, let me finish.  Let me finish.  That’s not what I said.  I said that we have a great negotiator at the table.  I certainly was not commenting on President Macron’s abilities; simply stating the obvious, that we have an incredibly good negotiator at the table for the United States., But what you do have are two leaders who have a great deal of respect for one another, who have a great friendship.  Certainly, both have a great deal of interest in doing what is best for their country, but being able to have very open and candid conversations because of the relationship not only that the leaders have built, but that has existed between the two countries long before either of these individuals arrived on the scene.  And we’re going to continue that relationship.  But I think we can expect this to be a very productive and very positive state visit for both countries., Q    Positive for France?, SANDERS:  I said for both countries., Q    Could the the President change his mind on some of these things?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of conversations that are going to take place.  But as we have any policy announcements, I’m sure you guys will be the first to know., Q    His mind is open?, SANDERS:  Again, the President wants to make good deals for this country.  And if he feels like he can make a good deal that benefits this country, he certainly is going to engage in those conversations., Peter., Q    Sarah, why should North Korea believe that the U.S. is an honest broker, when the President has said publicly that he would like to get out of the deal the U.S. and others made with Iran?, SANDERS:  Look, the President has been clear from day one that he thinks that’s a bad deal.  I don’t think any deal that he would sign and agree to he would consider a bad deal.  The President wants to do what is in the best interest —, Q    So he would never backtrack on this deal?, SANDERS:  The President wants to do what is in the best interest of our country and even in the world.  And particularly having North Korea and the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons, I think, is a good thing for everybody, and I think even you would be hard-pressed to find something different., Q    Sarah, beyond what you said about —, SANDERS:  Sorry, Peter, I’ve got tight time and I’m going to keep moving., Steve., Q    Yeah, Sarah, I just want to follow up on that about North Korea.  I’m wondering, what gives you any optimism that the North Koreans are really looking to denuclearize?  Because of the statements that they’re making, everybody seems to be jumping on the very positive aspects of the statements.  But they were also saying over the weekend that their completion of the nuclear arsenal, which they call their “powerful treasured sword,” firmly guarantees forever the country’s security and well-being.  That doesn’t sound like any wiggle room on denuclearization., SANDERS:  Certainly, we’re not going to make mistakes from previous administrations, and we’re not going to take the North Koreans simply at their word.  Like I said before and we’ve said many times before, the maximum pressure campaign is going to continue until we see concrete actions taken by — look, we’re not naïve in this process.  We’ve seen some steps in the right direction.  But we have a long way to go., We also have seen a major change in what has taken place in the past by having our allies and partners in the region step up and do much more than they have in the past.  China has taken a more active role in putting pressure on North Korea.  They can certainly do more — we hope they will — and will continue working with us.  And that’s all at the direction and because of the relationship that the President has built with President Xi of China., Yamiche., Q    I have two quick questions.  The first one is, that the New York Times and others reported that federal prosecutors have recommended charges against the New York police officer involved in Eric Garner’s death.  But the Justice Department has expressed some strong reservations.  Where do things stand with the case of Eric Garner, and when does the Justice Department — when are they going to make a decision about the police officer and whether or not they’re going to charge him?, SANDERS:  I don’t have an administration update on that front, but would refer you to the Department of Justice to get further details.  And I’ll work on getting an update for you and let you know., Q    And the second question I have is the President tweeted —, Q    Can you let all of us know?, SANDERS:  Sure.  Usually when we let one, it’s kind of a — it’s not exactly a secret.  But, yeah, I’d be happy to share that with everybody., Q    The second question is the President tweeted, “James Comey illegally classified documents to press in order — leaked documents to press [in order] to generate a Special Council?  Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act?  Really, does everyone know what that means?”  What does the President think that means?  And is he indicating that the Special Counsel should be fired because of the way that it was begun?, SANDERS:  As we’ve said many times before, we have no intention of firing the Special Counsel.  We’ve been beyond cooperative with them.  We’re continuing to cooperate with them.  Turned over nearly — over a million pages and documents to the Special Counsel and have been cooperative., Q    So what does it mean?, SANDERS:  Exactly what the President has been saying all along —, Q    Yeah, but the question that he posed?, SANDERS:  — that this was a false premise that this entire thing started on.  We continue to repeat that we think that the idea that the Trump campaign was involved in any collusion with Russia is a total witch hunt.  Our position on that has been very clear since the beginning of this process, and the President is echoing exactly what that position is., Jon., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Over the weekend, a fourth House Republican called for the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to step down.  He said he’s the wrong fit for the EPA.  What’s your reaction to that?, SANDERS:  Again, we’re reviewing some of those allegations.  However, Administrator Pruitt has done a good job of implementing the President’s policies, particularly on deregulation; making the United States less energy-dependent and becoming more energy independent.  Those are good things.  However, the other things certainly are something that we’re monitoring and looking at and I’ll keep you posted., Q    Last week, Andrew Wheeler was confirmed by the Senate.  He is Scott Pruitt’s deputy at the EPA.  Couldn’t he easily implement all of the President’s agenda if Scott Pruitt stepped aside?  He wouldn’t have a dark cloud hanging over the agency.  What’s your view on that idea?, SANDERS:  We’re very excited that the Democrats have finally allowed another one of our nominees to go through.  We hope that they’ll allow some of the other several hundred that sit waiting to be confirmed — very highly qualified individuals — we hope that they’ll continue to follow in the footsteps of that, and get a lot more people within this administration working., Blake., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  On the Iran nuclear deal, President Macron said don’t leave if there’s not a better option, and then the Iranian Foreign Minister tweeted today, “President Macron is correct in saying there’s no ‘Plan B’…  It’s either all or nothing.”  So my question to you is, does the White House believe that there is actually a realistic “Plan B” out there?, SANDERS:  We certainly think that there should be a better deal, one that actually is positive, that works.  And we don’t really typically look to the leadership in Iran to determine what our foreign policy is., Q    And then later today, on Mike Pompeo —, SANDERS:  Sorry, I’m going to keep moving just because we’re running out of time., John., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  You may not be willing to be specific about the matters that President Trump and President Macron will negotiate on, but the French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was very specific at the World Bank and IMF spring meeting.  He said on Friday, the French will insist on, and I quote, “a full and permanent exemption,” of any trade tariffs the United States might want to impose on France., He went on to say that if they are going to be a partner in dealing with China and other countries, they cannot have, what he called, a “sword of Damocles” hanging over them.  That’s pretty strong language.  Is trade and a permanent exemption —, SANDERS:  We can at least agree on that.  (Laughter.), Q    Is it on the table as Minister Le Maire wishes?, SANDERS:  Again, we certainly expect this to come up in conversations over the next two days.  When we have any policy announcements, we will absolutely let you know., Kevin., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Two quick ones.  One on Syria: Is it fair to say the President agrees with the French President that a precipitous or too-quick removal of America’s presence from Syria would be a danger or damaging to the Syrian people?  And if there is agreement there, is there a possibility that the two will come to some sort of a formal announcement during his time here?, And a follow on Mike Pompeo: What would be the number one issue that the President would like him to tackle assuming that, as expected, he is approved today?, SANDERS:  First, I’ll talk about the Syria question.  Again, certainly something that will come up.  The President is committed to defeating ISIS.  That is our primary goal and function and of being there.  We want to see that happen.  The President also wants to see the partners in the region step up and do more, both militarily and financially.  And that’s going to be something that I can imagine will be raised, and we’ll keep you posted on that front., When it comes to Director Pompeo, it is absolutely outrageous that he would not move through quickly.  He is extremely qualified for the positon.  The Washington Post, a number of other outlets that certainly aren’t typically the biggest advocates of this President, have said confirm him already., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:59 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President will speaking at 2:30 on the administration’s efforts to reduce red tape and federal regulations.  Within 10 days of taking office, President Trump issued Executive Order 13771, instructing the Office of Management and Budget to remove two government regulations for every new one created.  Washington scoffed, but the administration acted.  And under a year, we have unleashed the American economy, businesses, and job creation., These efforts, and the rest of the President’s agenda, have fueled economic growth, including all-time highs in the stock market, a 17-year low in unemployment rolls, new highs in manufacturing and consumer confidence, and much more., As the President said yesterday, we’re at the final stages of historic tax cuts and reforms that will provide massive relief to middle-class families, lower tax rates on American businesses to make us more competitive, and make our tax code simpler and fairer for the first time in decades., We want to begin lowering the tax bills in Americans’ paychecks starting next year, where Americans who faced economic headwinds for eight years will have the wind at their backs as they seek the American Dream., And with that, we’ll get started because we are on a short timeframe.  And I will take your questions., Jonathan., Q    Sarah, on the taxes, what is the President’s message to those Americans, including some in the middle class, who will face tax increases under this tax bill?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, our focus since day one has been to aggressively push to make sure as many Americans as possible get a tax break, particularly those in the middle class.  That’s going to continue to be our focus as we continue in this process, as I’ve said time and time again., Q    But the message to those that will face an increase?  I mean, every analysis showed some people, including middle-class Americans, are going to face an increase., MS. SANDERS:  And, overwhelmingly, the middle class will get a huge tax break, as most Americans will.  And that is, again — our goal is to make sure that more Americans see more of their hard-earned money.  That’s what we’re pushing for and that’s what we’re going to keep working with the House and Senate to make sure happens., John., Q    On taxes, you got two “no’s” in the Senate so far.  You got Senator Corker who’s been a “no” for a while.  Senator Rubio came out and told us a short time ago that he’s a “no” unless he can get an expansion of the child tax credit.  Is the President willing to be a little more generous in the child tax credit in order to get Senator Rubio’s vote?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, we’re really proud of the work that we’ve done already up until this point, with Senator Rubio, already doubling the child tax credit, taking it to $2,000 per child.  We’re going to continue working with the senator.  But we think we’ve made great strides and, frankly, pretty historic movement in terms of the child tax credit.  And we’re very proud of that work.  We’re going to keep working with him until we get the job done, which we still expect to happen before the end of the year., Q    Is there more room to move?, MS. SANDERS:  Right now, we’re going to focus on letting some of the Senate move forward in the progression of their conversations.  Again, we’re extremely excited about the progress that we’ve already made to double the child tax credit.  I think that’s something important to note and something that we’ve worked very closely with Senator Rubio on.  And we think he should be very excited about the progress we’ve made on that front., Connie., Q    Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas., MS. SANDERS:  Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas to you, as well., Q    Thank you.  What have you learned this past year?  And what changes would you make in the coming year?, MS. SANDERS:  What have I learned this past year?  I would have to say that we would be here a really long time if I walked through everything I’ve learned this past year.  But some of my favorite things would probably be to take time to appreciate some of the really incredible moments and the special time and opportunity and honor that certainly I have, but I think that all of us have that we get to come to the White House every day, serve our country, and we get to call it work.  I think that’s pretty impressive, pretty amazing, and something that I hope none of us ever lose sight of., Thanks, Connie.  Mara., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Does the President think that Roy Moore should concede?  In other words, does he believe he lost the election fair and square, or does he think he was the victim of widespread illegitimate voting?, MS. SANDERS:  I think the President’s position is pretty clear.  In his outreach to Doug Jones directly, he called and they spoke yesterday.  They had a great conversation, a very positive conversation.  He likes Doug Jones and looks forward to meeting him in person, and hopes that he will come and follow through on his commitment to work with the President on some things that they agree on., Q    So Roy Moore lost fair and square.  That’s what you’re saying?, MS. SANDERS:  I think the numbers reflect that, and I think the President’s outreach shows that., Jordan., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  There’s some reports out this morning that Speaker Ryan is considering stepping down at the end of this Congress.  Has the President spoken to Speaker Ryan about those reports?  And does he want to see Speaker Ryan continue in that role?, MS. SANDERS:  The President did speak to the Speaker not too long ago and made sure that the Speake knew very clearly and in no uncertain terms that, if that news was true, he was very unhappy with it.  The Speaker assured the President that those were not accurate reports and that they look forward to working together for a long time to come., Blake., Q    So did this catch the President by surprise, the Ryan report that was out today?, MS. SANDERS:  It sounds like it may have caught Speaker Ryan by surprise — (laughter) — because I don’t think it was very accurate reporting.  And so it sounds like they’re both committed to and looking forward to spending a lot more time together over the next, hopefully, seven, eight years., Q    And let me ask you about Marco Rubio, as well.  We have heard folks who might be “no” votes, potentially undecided votes.  But Marco Rubio’s potential “no” vote is one that we know it concerns, but him voting no is seemingly here suddenly out of left field.  Has that caught the White House by surprise at all?  Or have you braced for the possibility that you might not have Marco Rubio in your corner?, MS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure if the President has spoken with him specifically today.  Again, we’re proud of the work that we’ve done with Senator Rubio, and we look forward to making sure that the progress that we made to double the childcare tax credit — that’s kind of a mouthful — goes into full effect when this piece of legislation is signed., April., Q    Sarah, two things.  Should Roy Moore just give his concession speech now, versus holding it out?, MS. SANDERS:  It probably sounds like it may have — should have already taken place.  Look, the President has already called and congratulated Doug Jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and to meet with him when he arrives in Washington., Q    And the second issue:  Did you watch GMA this morning?  And what are your thoughts about this tell-all and the un-comfortability of Omarosa while she was here with some issues?, MS. SANDERS:  I did see some clips of that.  In terms of a tell-all, that’s a question I think you would have to ask her.  She resigned from her position yesterday.  She’ll be here later this afternoon.  We put out a statement yesterday, and I don’t have any changes to add to that., And certainly, as has been the practice in the past and will continue to be in the future, we don’t comment much further than that on personnel matters., Jeff., Q    Sarah, if she’s resigned and she’s going to —, MS. SANDERS:  It’s confusing because you guys are sitting next to each other.  (Laughter.), Q    If she’s resigned, but you said she will stay on — Omarosa will stay on through January 20th — why are the taxpayers continuing to pay her salary for another month if she’s no longer here at the White House?, MS. SANDERS:  As I just said, I’m not going to weigh in any further, as we often do.  And as is the practice, we’re not going to get deeper into personnel matters.  We’ve put out a statement.  The President likes Omarosa, thanked her for her service.  And, again, she’ll be here later this afternoon, so she’s resigned from her position, but there’s really nothing else to add on that front., Q    If she has resigned, though, why is she still on the payroll for another month?  Is that normal?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, there’s a lot of different protocols that take place in the government.  That’s part of the process.  If you want to reach out to HR, they might be able to walk you through that in a more detailed way — certainly not that I’m privy to.  Thankfully, I haven’t been through the process myself, so I can’t speak to it from firsthand., Q    On a separate matter, on the tax plan, if I could just ask:  Will the President ask the House and Senate to stay here in Washington and finish this bill, even if it means bleeding into the Christmas holiday?, MS. SANDERS:  We’re pretty confident that we’re going to get there before then, but this is something that I think that both the House, the Senate, and the President are all committed to seeing happen.  And we’re very hopeful that it will take place at the first of next week., Jeff., Q    Sarah, does the President have any thoughts about the Disney deal to buy 21st Century Fox?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that the President spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal, and thinks that — to use one of the President’s favorite words — that this could be a great thing for jobs, and certainly looks forward to, and hoping to see a lot more of those created., Q    And what does the President think about the FCC decision on net neutrality?  There are a lot of Americans, polls show, who are very opposed to that change., MS. SANDERS:  Look, the Trump administration supports the FCC’s effort to roll back burdensome regulations.  But as we have always done and will continue to do, we certainly support a free and fair Internet.  Anything beyond that, I’d refer you to the FCC., Matthew., Q    Getting back to that Alabama result, does what happened down there change the President’s relationship at all with Steve Bannon, given his big support for Moore?  And has it changed the President’s thoughts on Moore — on, excuse me, Mr. Bannon’s opposition to other incumbent Republican senators?, MS. SANDERS:  That’s a question you’d have to ask Mr. Bannon.  I’m certainly not going to speak for him., Q    Well, I’m asking about the President’s relationship., MS. SANDERS:  I know, but the second part of the question you asked about whether or not he would support more candidates, and I can’t answer that., In terms of their relationship, I haven’t spoken with the President directly about the nature of that relationship and whether that has altered it., Francesca., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  I know that you said that you can’t go much further on this personnel matter, but I do want to try to separate out some of the things that we’re hearing here and just be crystal clear., So you’re saying that Omarosa Manigault was not fired on Tuesday evening, that she didn’t get belligerent in her conversation with General Kelly, she wasn’t yelling at him, she wasn’t cursing at him, and she wasn’t escorted off the property — and Secret Service has said not by them — but she wasn’t escorted off the property by someone or some entity other than Secret Service that evening?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, as I said, Omarosa resigned from her position.  I’m not going to go into a detailed process any further than that.  We’ve put out a statement, as is standard practice.  We’re not going to get into the weeds of a personnel decision here at the White House., Q    In an interview with STAT News this morning, Kellyanne Conway said she and other administration officials have been urging Congress to appropriate additional funding for the opioid epidemic.  The President declared a public health emergency earlier this fall, but that fund only has $57,000 in it.  Economists have predicted that it will cost upwards of $190 billion over a decade to treat the crisis.  Can you tell us how much money the White House will be urging Congress to appropriate?  And what do you have to say to critics who believe that the President hasn’t dedicated enough resources to combatting the epidemic this year?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, one of the reasons that the President has put one of his top people here at the White House, Kellyanne Conway, on this is because he sees this as a priority; he sees it as a major concern, not just for the White House, but certainly for America.  There’s a number of stories, as you just said.  The amount of money that it will take to combat this crisis is huge.  We’re going to continue looking at the best ways to do that.  We’re working in an interagency process to see what that number looks like.  That hasn’t been finalized, but we’re going to continue looking at every way possible —, Q    Is it more —, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t — right now, that’s still part of —, Q    Is it around $45 billion that was a part of the Republican healthcare plan?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, that’s, I think, a start.  But to fully address this, we want to make sure that we get it right and make sure that we really address this head on.  And that’s why the President has made it such a focus and put Kellyanne and others here at the White House to really make an emphasis and make that a priority., Q    Is that money something that you guys will get done — that appropriation — by the end of this year?  Can the President promise that?, MS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware that we can promise that a full funding for that would take place by the end of this year.  This wasn’t a problem that happened overnight.  We’re not going to be able to fix it overnight.  But what we want to do is make sure that we address it and that we make it a priority for the administration.  And we’re going to continue doing that until we beat it — the President has spoken about this several times — and making sure that we address it from all fronts and all sides., Kristen., Q    Sarah, thank you.  With Omarosa leaving, how many senior staffers here, at the White House, are African American?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, we have a really diverse team across the board at the White House.  We always want to continue to grow the diversity here.  We’re going to continue to do that and continue to work hard., Q    Do you have a number on how many are African American?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t have a number directly in front of me — specifically not African American.  But I can say, again, we have a very diverse team at the White House, certainly a very diverse team in the press office.  And something that we strive for every day is to add and grow, to be more diverse and more representative of the country at large, and we’re going to continue to do that., Q    She was really tasked with reaching out to the African American community.  Have you identified who is going to take that role?  And how critical is it to this President, to this administration, to make sure that that role is, in fact, filled?, MS. SANDERS:  Yeah, I think there are number of people that will be part of that process, and have been part of that process, that will continue to be.  This wasn’t something that was a singular effort by any one individual.  A member on the Cabinet, Ben Carson, I know has been engaged and talked with the President on this issue.  But it’s not just within the White House.  The President met with Senator Tim Scott.  I know he wants to continue those conversations as well, to look at the best ways to do that and to do outreach to that community., Q    And just to follow up one of April’s questions.  What Omarosa said today was, “I’ve seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people.”  Were her concerns ever addressed or dealt with?, MS. SANDERS:  The comments that she made, that was the first time I’d heard those.  Whether she raised them with other individuals, I’m not aware.  I know she regularly brought up specific issues where they were talked about in meetings, and we addressed them at the time., Q    Do you know if any of the issues or any of her concerns were?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t.  That’s a question that you would have to ask her, and I’m certainly not going to speak on her behalf in that regard.  But I do know that it’s something that we take seriously and something that we want to see improve, I think, across all fronts., Margaret. Q    Sarah, today is the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre in which so many children were killed.  That, of course, as a tragedy, was eclipsed by what happened in Las Vegas, which is now the most tragic mass shooting on U.S. soil., Since that time, what has President Trump done to try to protect the American people against a similar type of massacre?  Does he think anything has been done?  What is the administration trying to do?  Is there anything at the executive level that he thinks needs to be undertaken?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think that there are a number of different ways that we look to protect our citizens.  Every single day, one of the areas that the President has been outspoken about — not necessarily to those two instances — but just more broadly speaking in terms of national security and protecting individuals certainly through border security, stronger vetting processes, and looking at whether or not there are other regulations that we could put in place that would offer protection –Q    But these were domestic shooters.  These weren’t people who entered the United States., MS. SANDERS:  Right.  And I said I’m speaking more broadly in terms of national security as a whole.  And look, this is a President who knows that his number-one responsibility is to look for ways to protect American citizens.  And we try to do that every single day., And whether or not there’s a regulation that could have been put in place, or not, that could have prevented those things, frankly, I’m not aware of what that would be.  But we want to look for every opportunity, every way possible, that we can to protect American lives.  And we’re going to continue doing that., Q    So is it correct to say that the administration is looking at how to prevent these kind of mass shootings by domestic shooters on U.S. soil?  Or is it just the issue of immigrants and terrorism?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that’s something that — absolutely, I know that’s something that the Department of Homeland Security looks at and talks about and works on every single day.  I don’t think there’s a person in this country that wouldn’t like us to find ways to protect people, and we’re certainly very supportive of that.  And that’s something that would be —, Q    But no one issue that that the President has highlighted that says he wants to make a priority to push forward?, MS. SANDERS:  Well, I don’t think there’s any one thing that you could do that could have prevented either one of those instances — those horrible, horrible tragedies., Q    But there were prescriptions given very quickly just the other day for this failed terrorist attack, which is why in these cases — I mean, this is the worst shooting on U.S. soil on President Trump’s watch., MS. SANDERS:  I understand that.  And that’s why I also think that you have to take these matters, obviously, very seriously.  But if you could name a single thing that would have prevented both of these, I’d love to hear it, because I don’t know what that would look like.  But we’re looking every single day at how you can protect American lives, how we can best protect American citizens., In terms of New York, we know for a fact this individual came through a chain migration system.  This is something the President has been outspokenly against and something that he wants to stop.  And that individual wouldn’t have been here in order to commit that crime if that wasn’t in place.  So that’s a fact that we do know., Q    Does it involve a weapons ban, any kind of regulation, any kind of mental health concerns?  Has the President specifically mentioned that as a possibility?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that they’re looking at some of the mental health issues.  It’s something the President has raised before.  But in terms of a specific policy that we’re moving forward with that would have prevented that, I’m not aware of what that would be., Trey., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  Has the President expressed any concerns regarding the FCC’s decision today to roll back these Obama-era regulations on net neutrality?  And then, moving forward, are there any assurances that the White House can offer to the American people who are concerned that the decision and vote today will lead to a less-free Internet?, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 2:13 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  This afternoon, the President is looking forward to officially announcing the new Chairman of his Board of Advisors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities., Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., who will be taking on this important role, is the former president of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and is currently CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management., As you all know, the President previously signed an executive order promoting excellence and innovation at HBCUs.  He believes this initiative will advance America’s full human potential.  And with today’s announcement, he continues to demonstrate his commitment to HBCUs., Before taking your questions today, I want to take a moment to highlight the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats — an issue that represents a threat to America’s interests and security., Compared to the four previous administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees.  Senator Schumer’s tactics have led to 73 fewer confirmations than the next closest administration.  Half of President Trump’s nominees are still waiting for confirmation in the Senate., The obstruction is so out of control, even some Senate Democrats believe it is inappropriate.  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said, “I don’t believe we should be holding nominees hostage…Enough is enough.  We need people who are qualified to fill these important positions in our government.”, In the coming days, we will be highlighting specific, qualified nominees who are, as the Senator said, being held hostage by Senator Schumer., Take, for instance, Ric Grenell, the President’s nominee to serve as Ambassador to Germany.  Mr. Grenell, a Harvard-educated, experienced diplomat, was the longest serving U.S. spokesperson at the United Nations.  He was nominated in September of last year.  He was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support.  He is waiting to represent America’s interests and be our country’s top voice in a G7 country., In short, Senator Schumer’s hyper-political delay on Mr. Grenell puts our national security, and America’s foreign policy interests, in jeopardy.  The Senate should move to confirm him immediately., We will continue highlighting more of these examples of Democrat obstruction in the days ahead., Finally, I’m sure — on a lighter note, I’m sure you all remember 11-year-old Natalie Dalton, who wrote in to the President, offering to cook for him.  We’re excited to announce today that Natalie, and her 8-year-old cousin Celia, will be coming to the White House on March 23rd to work with the White House kitchen staff.  We look forward to hosting them., And with that, I will take your questions.  Jonathan., Q    Sarah, Admiral Mike Rogers, the head of the NSA, said that he has not been granted any additional authority by the President to confront Russia — Russian cyber intrusion, interference with our election systems.  Why has he not been given that authority?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, just this week, they announced, through the State Department, that $40 million is being given to the Global Engagement Center to begin providing immediate support to private and public partners that expose and counter Russian and Chinese propaganda and disinformation.  We’re focused on looking at a variety of different ways.  As I told you last week, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, met with a number of both state, local, and federal officials working on ways that we can best prevent things like this in the future.  And we’re looking at a number of different options, and we’re going to continue doing that over the coming weeks., Q    But Admiral Rogers is the one that would have the agency that could actually go and confront Russian intrusion at the source.  And he hasn’t been given the authority.  In fact, he says that the Russians haven’t paid a sufficient price to make them change their behavior.  He’s the one with the power and with the means to do it.  All he needs is a presidential directive, the authority from the President to do it., MS. SANDERS:  I disagree with the premise of your question.  It’s not just one individual.  It’s looking at a number of different ways., Q    But why not give him the authority, though?  He’s in charge of Cyber Command.  Why not give him the authority?, MS. SANDERS:  Nobody is denying him the authority.  We’re looking at a number of different ways that we can put pressure.  Look, this President, as I told you last week, has been much tougher on Russia than his predecessor.  Let’s not forget that this happened under Obama.  It didn’t happen under President Trump.  If you want to blame somebody on past problems, then you need to look at the Obama administration., The President is looking at all of the different causes and all of the different ways that we can prevent it.  And as we find different ways that we can do that, we’re implementing them — like you see with the money that was allocated from the State Department, as you see with the conversations that the Secretary from DHS is having.  We’re going to continue looking at different ways to combat it, and I would imagine that that will be certainly a big part of it.  But I can’t speak to anything further on it right now., Q    This is not about the past, though.  This is not about the past.  This is about protecting intrusion in the next election., MS. SANDERS:  Exactly.  And that’s —, Q    And he said that he needs the authority, and he hasn’t been given it.  He says he can’t act without the authority., MS. SANDERS:  Well, I can’t speak to that specifically.  I can tell you that we are taking a number of steps to prevent this, and we’re looking at a variety of other ways that we’re going to continue to implement over the coming weeks and months., Justin., Q    I have one on the renewable fuel credit.  But first, just a housekeeping one on the clearances.  The Oversight Committee requested details from the White House about still-pending clearances among White House staff, and whether there is any derogatory information there.  They set a deadline of tomorrow.  The Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter over today asking for some of the same information.  I’m wondering if the White House is going to — plans to comply with those requests.  And if — I know you’ve been hesitant to release some of that information, even in aggregate —, MS. SANDERS:  I haven’t been hesitant.  I’ve been very clear that we don’t discuss security clearances.  And that’s not changing today, it didn’t change yesterday.  It’s not going to change tomorrow., Q    So you don’t plan to comply with the request from (inaudible)?, MS. SANDERS:  I didn’t say that.  I said I’m not going to discuss security clearances with members of the press.  And that hasn’t been different at any point during this administration, and we have no intention of changing it right now., Q    When are you going to comply with those tomorrow?, MS. SANDERS:  I’ll let you know when we have a chance to review that and make a decision., Q    But — can I do the fuel standard question?, MS. SANDERS:  Sorry, go ahead., Q    Yeah.  You guys put out a statement today saying that the President supports the renewable fuel credit, but also that he is in support of energy producers.  So it seems that the issue here is whether or not the President or the White House supports a cap to lower the cost of credit waivers.  So I’m wondering if you could tell us what the President’s position is on that., MS. SANDERS:  Look, the President knows that there are a lot of differing views on this issue.  We’re going to continue having conversations.  He met, today, with Senator Cruz, Ernst, Grassley, and Toomey to discuss this and to continue that conversation.  They had a productive meeting, and we’re going to continue working with not only those members but others as we go through this process., John., Q    Two questions, different topics.  If I could return to something that we talked about yesterday: the President’s support to raise the minimum age of buying a long gun from 18 to 21.  He expressed support for that idea in a tweet last Thursday.  He talked about it with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas.  He didn’t mention it at CPAC.  He didn’t mention with the governors.  He said he had lunch with Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox —, MS. SANDERS:  To be fair, of all of the governors, when that conversation was opened, none of them mentioned it either.  But — in a two-hour discussion., Q    But he had supported it, so.  He had lunch with Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox.  The NRA remains firmly opposed to this idea of raising the age for long guns.  The President said yesterday, if they’re not always with you, sometimes you got to fight them.  Is he willing to take on the NRA on this idea of raising the minimum age for buying long guns?, MS. SANDERS: The President still supports raising the age limit to 21 for the purchase of certain firearms.  We’re meeting with bipartisan members of Congress tomorrow.  We expect that to be a topic of discussion.  He knows that everybody doesn’t necessarily agree.  We’re not going to get into the details on the specifics of what we will propose, but we expect that to be part of the conversation tomorrow., Q    Question number two on an unrelated topic.  Jeff Sessions confirmed, a few minutes ago, that he is going to open an investigation into FISA abuses during the election.  The President clearly has been expressing that he believes that Sessions should look into this.  Is the President happy now that Sessions is opening this investigation?, MS. SANDERS:  I haven’t spoken with him about it to determine his feelings.  But as you said, it’s something that he’s clearly had frustration over, so I would imagine he certainly supports the decision to look into what we feel to be some wrongdoing.  I think that’s the role of the Department of Justice, and we’re glad that they’re fulfilling that job., Margaret., Q    Sarah, I have one question.  But one housekeeping item before that.  You talked about nominations and how slow Congress is to move.  I’m wondering, do you have a timeline on when the White House will name a nominee to be ambassador to South Korea?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t have a timeline, and I don’t have any personnel announcements on that position, specifically., Q    Okay.  And then the question I had, again, going back to Admiral Rogers.  He said today, we are not where we need to be or want to be on cyber.  Does the White House, does the President plan to hold a National Security Council session to discuss, specifically, these concerns about having a menu of options to respond to a cyberattack, and one specifically in relation to Russia?, MS. SANDERS:  In terms of a specific meeting, I don’t know that a date is set.  But I do know that there are constantly conversations going on within the administration on this topic.  And we’re going to continue those, and I’ll keep you posted on the President’s schedule., Q    Has there been one so far on Russia and cyberattacks?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that he’s been briefed on it.  In terms of specifics beyond that, I’d have to check and get back to you., Jordan., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Did anyone from the White House instruct Hope Hicks not to answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee about her time serving in the White House and in the transition?, MS. SANDERS:  As is always the case, I’m not going to comment on any individual’s interactions with the Committee.  But we are cooperating because, as the President has said repeatedly, there is no collusion.  And we’re going to continue to cooperate.  Hopefully they’ll wrap this up soon., Q    Why did she refuse to answer the questions about —, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to comment on any individual’s specific interactions with the committee.  I’d refer you to outside attorneys for that., Jon., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  I just want to pick up on what Jordan was just asking you, and that is about this idea of citing executive privilege for conversations that took place during the transition period.  We’re told that’s exactly what Hope Hicks, the Communications Director, cited in refusing to answer questions that were posed of her related to the transition period.  Is the President aware, is the White House aware that no federal court, at any level, has ever granted that privilege pertaining to the transition period?, MS. SANDERS:  Just because we ask the question in different ways, I’m still not going to comment on any individual’s interactions with the committee.  I’m also not going to comment on leaks from what is supposed to be a confidential setting.  There continues to be zero evidence of collusion, and we hope these investigations wrap up shortly., Steve., Q    To follow up on what Margaret was asking.  Joseph Yun, the State Department’s envoy to North Korea, is retiring.  How does that impact the diplomatic process?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, we’re going to continue appointing people to different positions, whether it’s the Ambassador to South Korea and a number of other positions.  I don’t have any specific announcements on it at this time., Q    And secondly, the Chinese economic minister is here for trade talks.  As you consider tariffs on steel and aluminum, what do you hope to hear from this fella?, MS. SANDERS:  He’s meeting with a few different members of the administration, but not the President directly.  I don’t have any specific readouts from any of his meetings at this point., Q    Thank you very much.  House Speaker Ryan, today, disagreed with the President on arming teachers.  He says he thinks it should be up to the locals whether teachers should be armed.  What is the President’s response to not having support from the Republican leader of the House?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, as we’ve said, this is something that will continue to be part of the discussion with state, federal, and local officials as well as law enforcement.  The President is going to be meeting with bipartisan lawmakers tomorrow, and that will be another one of those topics discussed, and we’ll have further specific policy announcements later this week., Q    But without the support of Speaker Ryan, how can this get any traction in the House?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, this is part of an ongoing conversation.  It’s something that the President still supports.  It’s something he knows that there are a lot of differing views on.  It’s one of the topics that we expect to come up tomorrow and we’re going to continue having that discussion., I think the number-one thing that we’re looking at is, every possible action that we can take that helps protect the safety and security of the schoolkids across this country, we’re going to look at everything we can.  A lot of those things that you guys have brought up today will be part of the discussion tomorrow.  And we expect to have some specific policy proposals later this week., Steve., Q    Yes, Sarah.  Today, the White House announced that it’s cutting about $8 million in aid to Cambodia for what it calls, “Recent setbacks in democracy there.”  Can you talk a little bit about what went into this decision, and why, specifically, just Cambodia, and not other countries where there have also been recent setbacks to democracy, such as neighboring Thailand?, MS. SANDERS:  The elections that happened earlier this month failed to represent the genuine will of the Cambodian people.  That gave us great cause for concern.  These setbacks compelled the United States to review that assistance.  Based on the review, the government will suspend or curtail several assistance programs intended to support the Cambodian government.  I don’t have anything further at this point., Anita., Q    Two questions on two different topics.  First, does President Trump believe that the governor of Missouri — who, as you know, has been indicted — should resign?, MS. SANDERS:  I haven’t spoken with him about that., Q    Okay can you go back to —, MS. SANDERS:  But my guess is that he would refer to the people of the state of Missouri, but I haven’t spoken directly with him, so I would have to get back to you., Q    The President is the leader of the Republican Party, and obviously the governors —, MS. SANDERS:  I’m well aware., Q    Well, I mean, he’s a Republican —, MS. SANDERS:  Anita, I haven’t spoken with him.  I’d have to ask him., Q    Can you get back to me on that?, MS. SANDERS:  Sure., Q    Okay.  Second question.  The President is having several meetings, as you mentioned, with lawmakers of both parties this week on other topics.  Is he going to be talking to them about immigration?  His deadline that he set, March 5th, is next Monday.  Congress is nowhere near doing anything about that.  Is that still the deadline?  Is he encouraging them to get something done?, MS. SANDERS:  Absolutely, he’s encouraging them to get something done.  That’s why he laid out exactly what he expected to see in a proposal that would not only help solve the DACA problem, but also provide border security.  The President went above and beyond what previous administrations have done and offered on that program., It’s really sad that Democrats are not willing to come to the table, get something done, and actually fix problems and do their job.  But the President is still hopeful, and we’re going to continue pushing forward and hope we get something done., Q    So, on Monday — what’s going to happen on Monday when the deadline comes?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, we’re still hopeful that something happens on this and that Congress will actually do its job., Olivier., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  I’ve got a couple for you as well.  One on North Korea.  Joseph Yun, who’s been the point person for North Korea policy, has announced he’s leaving.  Does the President plan to replace him?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t have any personnel announcements at this time., Q    And then on the — we’re heading into the midterm election year, obviously.  Have White House staff been briefed on the dos and don’ts of political activity, including the prohibition on using formal titles in campaign literature?, MS. SANDERS:  I know for sure that Cabinet and senior staff have been, and I believe a paper memo was distributed to all staff, but I’d have to verify that to be sure.  But I know that both Cabinet and senior staff have been briefed on upcoming midterm elections and what they are allowed to do and not do., Mara., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Does the President believe someone who’s on the no-fly list because of suspected terrorist activity should be able to buy a gun?, MS. SANDERS:  We haven’t spoken about that specifically and don’t have any policy announcement on that front., Q    I don’t want a policy announcement.  I just want to know if he thinks that somebody —, MS. SANDERS:  Well, that would be a policy.  Whether or not the President supports something or not would be a policy., Q    So he doesn’t know?, MS. SANDERS:  I said we haven’t — I haven’t spoken with him about it, so I’d have to get back to you., John., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Briefing Room, 1:41 P.M. EDT, MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First, at the top, I wanted to note that the President has been briefed on the situation in London. He just spoke to Prime Minister May, and we’ll have a readout on that situation and that call soon., We obviously condemn today’s attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism. And we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation. The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers., The City of London and Her Majesty’s government have the, \\nfull support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible. We will provide you with further updates as warranted and, as I mentioned, a readout of the President’s call with the Prime Minister., Turning to the events of today — this morning, the President received his daily intelligence briefing. He stopped by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems Administrator, Seema Verma. And also, that event was attended by the Vice President and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price., Healthcare professionals have seen the challenges of implementing Obamacare firsthand. They’re a valuable asset to the President and his team as we continue to consider and enact policies, like the American Health Care Act, that will make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone., The women who were at the roundtable today represent the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and administrators who make sure that people around the country receive the necessary preventative and lifesaving care that they need every day., \\nThe doctors who attend to the patients in the family practices, emergency rooms, and clinics — and those who support them on the administrative and technical sides — are one of our country’s most treasured resources., With the passage of the American Health Care Act and the rest of the President’s healthcare reform agenda, everyone, regardless of their financial situation, will be able to take full advantage of this resource., That’s why, at last count, over 40 major associations have expressed their support for the American Health Care Act, with several of them, including the U.S. Chamber [of Commerce], the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and, just today, the National Taxpayers Union calling it a key vote., Following his appearance at the panel, the President and his legislative affairs team hosted several members of the House of Representatives for another meeting on the American Health Care Act. The President acknowledged, as he has before, that the AHCA is only one step in the larger process of fixing the broken healthcare system created by Obamacare, but it’s an essential first step., Undoing and fixing all of the misguided policies is going to require a holistic, multistep process. And that’s why the President and his team are fully committed to maintaining an open line of communication with Capitol Hill leadership throughout this entire process., Throughout the weeks since the AHCA was first introduced, they have been meeting with Republican members from across the political spectrum, many of whom we’ve seen move from “no” to “yes,” as they learn more about the legislation and amendments that have been adopted. Continued coordination between administrative and legislative actions will ensure that our new healthcare system is effective and efficient., This afternoon, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus’s Executive Committee. The President has brought in and will continue to hear from representatives of all interests as he continues to note that he is the President of all Americans. Diversity makes our nation strong, and it also means that we don’t necessarily agree on every policy item but that we continue to have a dialogue towards productive policies that help America move forward., The President looks forward to discussing the CBC’s policy priorities and finding ways that they can work together where those priorities align., This evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary, \\nof State Tillerson. Today at the State Department, Secretary Tillerson hosted the foreign ministers and senior leaders of the Global Coalition working to defeat ISIS for the first meeting of the full coalition of 68 members since December 2014. This meeting follows up on the defense ministerial Secretary Mattis hosted last month in Brussels., The coalition is united in the fight against ISIS, and this meeting seeks to accelerate international efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it holds in Iraq and Syria, while maximizing pressure on its branches, affiliates, and networks., \\nThis meeting is a part of our whole-of-government approach to defeating ISIS. The Trump administration will use all of the tools of national power, in coordination with our international powers [partners], to cut off ISIS’s funding, expand intelligence sharing, and deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens., Also today, over on the Hill, Judge Gorsuch [is] in his second day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his nearly 12 hours of questioning yesterday — now at least I know how someone else feels — (laughter) — the judge continued to prove himself an enormously qualified jurist that Americans will all be proud to see on the Supreme Court. It’s not surprising that Senate Democrats are failing to gain traction for any of their potshots and opposition to Judge Gorsuch. There’s simply not enough politicizing the Senate Democrats can do to hide the fact that Judge Gorsuch is an immensely qualified and thoughtful jurist with a lifelong dedication to our Constitution., A few administrative notes here before I take your questions: Last night, we formally announced that the President will travel to Brussels for the May 25th meeting of NATO heads of state and government. During this meeting, the President looks forward to reaffirming our strong commitment to NATO and discussing critical issues to the Alliance, especially Allied responsibility-sharing and NATO’s role against — the fight against terrorism., The President will also host NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to the White House on April 12th., Today, the President declared a major disaster exists in the state of Wyoming and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in February., We also announced that the President will deliver this year’s commencement address at Liberty University on May 13th., \\nThe President is proud to call Liberty’s president, Jerry Falwell, his wife Becki and their entire family, his friends, and looks forward to celebrating the success of this amazing graduating class on such a momentous occasion., Finally, a few minutes ago, many of you may have seen that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, gave remarks on the surveillance collected on individuals associated with the President. Let me quote him directly:, \\n“I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in the intelligence community reporting. And third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or [of] the Trump team.”, My understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming to the White House later to brief the President on this development, and we will have a readout for that meeting once it occurs., With that, I’ll be glad to take your questions. Mara., Q Two questions. One on Nunes and then healthcare. Is your understanding that this — none of these unmasked names were leaked?, MR. SPICER: I don’t know. I literally read the statement — or heard the statement, came out and briefed it. It was wrapping up as we were beginning this., Q Okay. Today in the pool spray, the President said “keep your doctor, keep your plan” didn’t work out that way. You didn’t get your doctor. You don’t get your plan. This is one of the reasons we have to repeal Obamacare., Is the President assuring people who currently like their plan or like their doctor that under the American Health Care Act they can keep their doctor and their plan?, MR. SPICER: Well, that’s the hope. And what I mean by that is not to be cute, but last time they were promised something that didn’t turn out. I can’t promise something that a doctor stays in a plan or a plan stays there. But that’s a bit different., We understand that we’re letting market forces come into play here. Competition. Doctors can change what insurances they take. Plans can come in and out of markets., What I think we can be assured of is a couple of things. One is that currently under Obamacare, premiums are set to continue to skyrocket. We’ve seen an average of 25 percent. We’ve noted before in Arizona, they’ve gone up 116 percent. I think there’s no question that the additional competition and amendments that have been brought into this discussion will help lower the trajectory of that, number one., Number two is I think that they’re going to see greater choice. So I think those are the things that we’re willing to talk about being part of this plan because you can’t — where they erred last time is went out and made promises that they couldn’t keep. And I think that one of the problems that they did is that they’ve tried to suppress market forces and competition. And instead of lowering costs and increasing choice, which is what they sought to do, it did the opposite. So that’s where this is headed, and I think that’s important., John., Q Thanks a lot, Sean. On the AHCA, Mark Meadows, who appears to be a firm no in terms of his opposition to the replacement bill, said that 25 members of the Freedom Caucus are opposed to this replacement bill. Do you dispute those numbers?, MR. SPICER: I’m not going to share our whip count. I know we saw Lou Barletta, who was a hard no, come out and say he’s yes. Steve King I believe had been a no; he’s a yes. Member by member we’re seeing tremendous support flow in our direction, and the count keeps getting stronger for us. So I’m not going to start to get into yes or nos. But I would just say that former Congressman Mulvaney, now Director of OMB Mulvaney, who is a leader in that caucus, has been a very strong advocate of this policy. As you know, he’s been up on the Hill talking to his former colleagues, assuring them of the effort and why the process has to go the way it does., But I’m optimistic in the sense of what we’re seeing and the trajectory that this is going, and the number of votes that are flowing our way, not the other way., Q And on the confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch, I have not seen any Democrat come out in support of Judge Gorsuch just yet. Do you anticipate that you’ll get Democratic support on this particular nomination?, MR. SPICER: I hope and believe so. I think that there have been several that have been spoken very positively. I think he’s been extremely impressive throughout this confirmation process, and you’ve heard members both in the Senate, on the committee, and then a lot of outside voices comment on how well he’s done, how qualified he is. And I think it’s tough for anybody to say that he’s not immensely qualified for this position., Alexis., Q Sean, related to Congressman Nunes, can you explain why the White House has agreed to meet with him at all about what his findings are? And the reason I ask that is because the minute that Director Comey said that there was an official investigate, it might appear as if the White House is interfering with the investigation. And Congressman Nunes should present his information not to the White House but to the FBI. So why is anyone here at the White House agreeing to meet with him about his findings?, MR. SPICER: We’ll have a readout for you after that meeting. I think he did this press conference. He made the announcement that he was coming up to see the President to share these findings. I don’t know who else he’s shared them with. I don’t know — to your question, I don’t know if he’s briefed anyone else on it in terms of the intelligence community — either Admiral Rogers or Comey — of whether this is something they shared with him., But I think after the meeting, hopefully depending on the classification level, we may be able to share more on that with you., Q Can I just add, is the President concerned at all that there will be an appearance immediately, today that he has interfered with an ongoing investigation — whether it’s a congressional investigation or the executive branch investigation by meeting privately with a congressman who says he has information?, MR. SPICER: So let me get this straight. Number one, we asked — as you know, two weeks ago, we said this was the appropriate venue., Number two, you guys have asked us over and over again, why aren’t we meeting with certain individuals. The chairman of the committee that — one of the two committees that we asked to look into this — wants to share his findings, or what he knows. I think that is exactly how we’ve talked about this working. But I would leave it to Congressman Nunes to come up, and to brief and share his thoughts. I don’t know what his plan is. Obviously, he sat — he briefed the media before he briefed us. He went down and talked about what he had found., So, you know, it’s interesting, I didn’t see any complaints from you guys when he went down and held a press conference for the umpteenth time talking about his findings and what he’s found. There is no complaints from the media when he shares what he has found with you guys. But when he wants to come up here and tell us, this is where the investigation stands and here’s what I’ve unloaded — or excuse me, learned — there’s seems to be a little bit of an interesting double standard on that., Q Just to close the loop, because the President said that he had additional information that he believed the White House or he or his representatives would present, related to this investigation, what Congressman Nunes has is not related to that?, MR. SPICER: I don’t — you’re asking me questions that — he has not briefed us. He has not briefed the President. You guys, as I noted — he actually went down and spoke to the media before he shared this with us., So I would ask the colleagues that of yours that ask questions, more than you have — you’ve had — collectively, the media has more of an opportunity to ask questions and to hear what he has to say than we do at this point. So once we have more to understand what he said, to the extent that we can, I’m sure we’ll be glad to share it with you. But the media has more information than we do at this point., Jon., Q Sean, staying on that, didn’t we already know that there was incidental collection of intelligence involving some members of the transition team? And I point to —, MR. SPICER: Not the way you guys ask the questions. I mean, you questioned us every day about what we knew, and now you’re coming back to me saying, didn’t we already know this. Well — I’m doing somewhat of an effective job., Q No, but didn’t we already know that Flynn was monitored in his conversations with Kislyak?, MR. SPICER: Right., Q So we know —, MR. SPICER: Again, I guess my point, John, is I don’t know. He made a statement, went down to the press. Until we get briefed on this, until the President gets briefed, I don’t know what he knows. And so to ask — until that occurs, and until we have the ability to share some of that in an unclassified nature, I don’t want to get ahead of it. I don’t know what he knows. That’s why, apparently, he’s coming up to share his findings with the President. At least that’s what he said. Again, let’s wait and see how this unfolds., Q And on the American Health Care Act, Mark Meadows says they don’t have the votes, they need to start over and do a new bill. That sounds like you’re in pretty serious trouble., MR. SPICER: No, that sounds like one member’s opinion. As I mentioned —, Q Who represents a large contingent of people who oppose the bill., MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but again, I just named a few of the members that are part of that caucus that have come on board. I think that — look, every day, you see more and more of those members from that caucus and throughout the entire conference express their support for the bill. The President was up yesterday for a while talking to them., We’ve had members — and the Vice President has been actively engaged — Mick Mulvaney, Reince Priebus, Marc Short and Rick Dearborn, who lead our leg affairs team. These guys have been flooding the Hill. They’ve been on the phone, having meetings with them. There’s been a series of members up here all day. I think the trajectory is going very well for us., Q And Heritage Action says you can easily fix this bill simply by removing the regulatory framework — the tax credits and all of that — and you’ll get massive buy-in from conservatives. But can you do that?, MR. SPICER: There are certain constraints that we have in the reconciliation process. And for those who are steeped in the arcane rules of the Senate, there’s a thing called the Byrd Rule, and it does not allow policy to be recreated. It has to do with the budgetary nature of that vehicle to get — that’s sustainable at 50 votes. Right now, there are certain things that I think a lot of people would like but that will not potentially get ruled in order by the Senate parliamentarian., So I understand what people want, but I think that we have created a vehicle to get this done. This is the only way that we will repeal and replace Obamacare. And again, I think people have to recognize that there is a three-step process to doing this. This is exactly how the Democrats enacted it, and this is exactly how we will unwind it and implement a much better system. That’s it, plain and simple., Margaret., Q Sean, I know you can’t get ahead of Nunes, but what he said was, incidental, legal surveillance using a FISA warrant, which would —, MR. SPICER: I don’t believe he said FISA warrant., Q He did., MR. SPICER: Did he? Okay., Q He did. And that’s why I’m asking this question, which is, does the Trump administration have the presumption that foreign leaders or foreign nationals will not be surveilled when they are in contact with —, MR. SPICER: No, look, again, as I said, I don’t want to start talking or guessing what he may say or may not say, or explain this. I think that we will have more information, or I hope to have more information once the President is briefed, and to find out what else has gone on in terms of additional information on this. But I do think it is a startling revelation and there’s a lot of questions that need to get asked. I think it’s interesting all of the questions are in the presumptive negative towards us, as opposed to “why was this taking place, why were people surveilled ostensibly; they were involved in the campaign.” Because it’s not —, Q Well, that’s why I’m trying to clarify that —, MR. SPICER: No, no, the question is — the question —, Q — was your presumption that foreign nationals —, MR. SPICER: No, no, it’s not a presumption. Actually, I’m not the one —, Q (Inaudible.), MR. SPICER: Right. Respectfully, I’m not the one with the presumption — you guys are. I didn’t come up here presuming anything. I actually started my comments off by saying that —, Q Well, I would presume that foreign nationals are being monitored by U.S. intelligence when they are talking to anyone., MR. SPICER: And then the question — I think there’s a series of questions, which is, how many times was an individual picked up? Why were they picked up? Were they unmasked? Again, a lot of this, if they’re picked up during a FISA warrant, is that American citizens are prohibited by law from being unmasked, from “having their name put out there.” Why would someone’s name get put out there? What ways were they described? There’s a lot of questions that need to get asked. Those are the relevant issues that need to get asked. How many times was one individual followed? Did their name get unmasked, and why? But there’s a lot of things that need to get followed up on. We’re not at that position yet, as I’ve said now multiple times. The Chairman is going to come up here, brief the President, I don’t know to what extent and to what detail. But hopefully, as we move forward, we will have more., Q Is this what you’ve been — because you’ve said there’s more information to come, more information to come. Is this what you’ve been gesturing towards?, MR. SPICER: I don’t know. For the eighth time, there is no — we don’t know what he’s going to come up here and explain and share. And until that happens, for me to talk about where we think this is headed — again, we’re not in the business of trying to get to this point yet. We say, this is what they have. We’ve asked that the investigation be conducted and that people gather up information. What they have and to what extent, we’ll know soon., April., Q Sean, I have a series of questions on a topic. Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, met with an official here at the White House yesterday. She’s looking for fairness and justice in her son’s case. What should we expect to come out of that meeting with this White House official? Should there be a push to make sure that there is an indictment of the police officer’s —, MR. SPICER: I mean, that’s a Department of Justice question. For us to get involved in a case, a specific case, would be highly inappropriate in terms of trying to guess what the outcome of a case should be., Q Well, along that line, the official, according to Ms. Carr, reached out to the Department of Justice, the civil rights division, had the wrong number; called another department, had the right number. Now, in previous administrations, to include the Obama administration and other administrations, the Department of Justice had limited the numbers of people to call over to the Department of Justice. Has the Attorney General, this Attorney General Sessions, changed that memo? What has he done?, MR. SPICER: Well, it would have to be reissued. That’s a separate issue in terms of — every Attorney General issues a memo going back to, I think, Mukasey was the first one — post-Watergate — I’m trying to remember who issued the first one. But it has been a practice of I think almost every Attorney General to issue a memo spelling out the procedures that officials in the Justice Department contact the White House and who they can contact, and the nature of which and what their exceptions are, et cetera. Those memos get crafted by each administration, by each new Attorney General., I would refer you back to the Department of Justice on the status of that under this Attorney General., Q So how many officials here have that right, to call the Department of Justice, even if it’s for —, MR. SPICER: I don’t know the answer. I would refer you to the Department of Justice., Q But was there wrongdoing in this effort to call over to the Department of Justice?, MR. SPICER: I don’t know. I don’t know the nature of — I’ll have to look into what you’re asking. But I would, again, refer you back to the Department of Justice., Hunter., Q Yes. Thank you, Sean. I have two quick questions. Last November, President Trump dismissed reports he was trying to obtain security clearances for his children as “a typically false news story.” Now there are reports Ivanka Trump is indeed attempting to obtain a clearance. What changed there?, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:48 P.M. EDT, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President is constantly monitoring Hurricane Irma, and the federal government is working closely with our state and local partners to ensure the safety of the coastal communities., In his Weekly Address to the nation this morning, the President noted that this is a storm of historic destructive potential, and he’s asking that everyone in the storm’s path remain vigilant and heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement., Our message to the American people is this:  With gratitude for our first responders, and prayers for those in the storm’s path, we are behind you 100 percent., With that, I’d like to bring up the President’s Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, to discuss specifics on the federal government’s ongoing preparedness and response efforts., And after, I’ll be up to take further questions.  Thanks., MR. BOSSERT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Thanks to each of you for being here.  I can’t add too much more to that, so let me see if I can just jump in a little bit to my thinking here.  As you’ve heard me say before, I like to try to categorize my thoughts into informing, influencing, and inspiring, if I can., In terms of informing, please recall the process here is that the federal government, under President Trump’s leadership and the leadership of his Cabinet, is fully engaged, but they’re fully engaged in support of the governors.  Those governors at this point are engaged in various different forms and phases of what we consider incident management., So as I walk through Irma, let me stop — I’d be remiss if I didn’t — and talk about Texas and Harvey., So, Governor Abbott and I have been in close contact and haven’t stopped that contact, because his people in Texas and the people of Louisiana, under Governor Edwards, are involved in the early stages of what will be a long recovery effort., The people in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the other Caribbean islands affected by Harvey [Irma] already are in the middle of acute lifesaving and life-sustaining response operations., And what we’re seeing in Florida and South Carolina and Georgia are the final stages of preparation for the beginning of response operations., So we’re seeing all three play out for us at the same time.  It requires us to juggle some of our thinking, but it doesn’t require us to juggle our resources., So, to be clear, the response operations have ceased lifesaving and life-sustaining in Harvey, and we had an opportunity to rest and refit our forces, move them out, and reposition them for Harvey [Irma].  We’re right now employing them in the islands to save lives, and we will maintain a good footprint and posture to do the same in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia as the storm progresses., So I’ll come back to some of the path and the track and forecast here in a moment.  I’d like to see if I could reinforce that by suggesting we take this very seriously.  It’s not only a dangerous storm; we’ve already seen loss of life.  This storm has taken lives already.  It’s going to take more, unfortunately, if we’re not prepared.  So please take it seriously., I’d also suggest now, in terms of influencing, that people stop watching so carefully this track, and start thinking a little bit more seriously about getting themselves into a safe place and out of danger.  Now, I don’t want them to take that as a call for shadow evacuations.  Please listen to your local authorities on evacuation orders.  They’re not only looking out for your best interest, but they’re carefully coordinating.  This is a peninsula, and so people need to evacuate from south to north, and that is a staggered and carefully thought-through process., But what I am suggesting is, at this point this is a large storm.  And whether it wobbles left or wobbles right, you need to at this point start thinking through your own personal accountability.  So please make sure — it’s kind of an oxygen mask theory — take care of yourself first so you can take care of others, take care of your loved ones.  And if you’re able, please take care of strangers and others in need.  I think that’s something that we’ve seen in Texas and I have every reason to believe that the people of Florida and South Carolina will show that same American spirit and value., Lastly, if I can, there’s been a lot of kind of coverage of Florida but not necessarily media coverage of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  And if I can, I’ll give you a brief update on where we stand there., We are, as I just talked to Department of State and Department of Defense officials, engaging in this lifesaving, life-sustaining operation in the following way:  Governor Mapp is experiencing loss of power; loss of water, as a result; loss of communications; and some other sheltering needs.  And so what we’re doing is sending in air operations and surface operations to evacuate citizens.  We’re also doing that in St. Martin and St. Maarten, the Dutch-French island that’s been reported there are some American citizens there., We are currently in the final stages of operations planning to evacuate those citizens.  There are numbers ranging from 350 to 6,000.  That was our planning assumption parameter.  Those American citizens will be removed via surface and air means.  We’ve had to do some kind of planning adjustment for surf conditions for wind and for Hurricane Jose as we look forward to that hopefully missing the United States.  It’s unfortunately still causing some havoc in the islands, in our response operations, our evacuation operations., So that’s where we stand on that.  They’ll begin executing those plans, if not already, at some point soon today.  And we’ll see some of those American citizens and other evacuated as necessary, to include anyone with critical or acute medical needs., So that’s where I would stop on the update, and I’ll take your questions., Q    Tom, one of the big problems with the Florida evacuation is that so many gas stations are running out of gasoline.  What, if anything, can the federal government do in the next 24 hours to assist in getting more fuel to the people in Florida?, MR. BOSSERT:  So there’s a number of things that we’ve done.  I should stop and mention by name, Governor Scott — tremendous leadership, tremendous confidence.  He and the President have spoken, and I have spoken.  I’ve got every confidence in the governor and his emergency manager.  They’re demonstrating the same leadership resolve and skill and quality of effort that we saw in Texas a week ago., What we’re seeing in Florida, though, are fuel shortages.  We saw those same fuel shortages in Texas because people appropriately gas up their generators, their cars, their boats and so forth., So what we’ll see here now is a need to pull in additional fuel, and that need will run up against the onset of tropical storm force winds., So what are we doing?  We’re bringing in as much supply of refined fuel as possible, and we’ve waived a particular statute that allows for foreign flag vessels to help in that effort.  So it’s little technical, but it’s called the Jones Act.  Some of you have reported on it.  What happens is the Secretary of Homeland Security can waive that act.  Until that’s waived, only U.S. flag vessels can move fuel from point to point, domestically., What we’ve done now is we’ve freed up that prohibition, so now foreign flag vessels — so as many ships, tanker ships as possible are now being brought to bear on the effort to bring as much fuel as possible and to help Floridians, regardless of their flag vessel status.  And that’s the best we can do.  In addition, they’re planning all the intermodal points to get trucks from those tanker ship port locations into the gas stations.  So that’s what we’re doing., Q    The window is rapidly closing.  How much more can you get in there?, MR. BOSSERT:  The conditions will dictate that.  I don’t think there will be too much more that we can get in.  At some point here they’ll have to stop those operations.  And again, that’s one of my messages here.  It’s not a tough love message, it’s just a message of clarity and honesty., At some point, people are going to be on their own, so to speak, for a period of time during which the flooding, the raining, and the wind bear down on them, and they need to be prepared if they are in that path and haven’t taken some action to get themselves in a less dangerous position, to be ready for at least a 72-hour period.  That would be my advice for them to have enough food, water, and shelter before the government can get back in., We have pre-deployed and pre-staged, but we can’t actually get to that final point of care until conditions permit., Q    One housekeeping question.  For FEMA to have resources and no broken chain there, the President needs to sign legislation the House just passed this morning.  Any indication of when that’s going to happen?, MR. BOSSERT:  So I’d like to start by thanking Congress.  They came in in a fast way to give us the emergency supplemental funding.  I think that’s what you’re alluding to., First, FEMA still has the money that they need, so there’s no break in operations — I want to make sure to clarify on your question there — but there will be a break in their operations if they run out of money.  That’s why that supplemental legislation was so necessary.  Thank you to the House and Senate leadership for bringing everyone back in and passing that so quickly and responsibly., We anticipate, honestly, this is a real-time event.  The bill might be on its way up here right now, and requires signature by the Speaker, signature by the Senate leadership or the Vice President, and then a signature by the President of the United States.  And so I think that will happen today, but as soon as we get it, the President will take that seriously., Q    Talk to us about the complication of a storm track — and we don’t know the wobbling nature of it, but it looks like it’s going to cover the entire peninsula, running south to north.  How does that complicate emergency management response as it moves up the state?  And to Floridians who are veterans of hurricanes, there is sometimes a tendency to say, I can ride this one out, I’ve seen bad storms before.  Could you address both of those?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yes, of course.  Some people call it “hurricane amnesia.”  Let’s hope there’s no hurricane amnesia, but I would start by saying there are some people — probably some 20 percent of the population — that might not remember or might not have gone through the last big hurricane in Florida.  It was probably 2004 or 2005, right?  There were four major hurricanes in 2004; Wilma in 2005, which was forgotten because of Katrina., \\nIf you haven’t experienced it, take it seriously and ask those who have.  If you have experienced it, please recall that what I just described took place.  You were without power, you were without comms, and you were without water, in some cases, or sewer treatment and so forth for a period of time afterwards.  So plan for that., In terms of the track, there’s three considerations.  The upper-right, northeast quadrant of the storm packs the most punch.  The second consideration is, if the eyewall gets over land, it tends to lose steam a little faster; so if it stays over water, it tends to keep its strength a little longer.  And so as this thing moves left and right, it can affect our operations because it can affect a different part of the state in a different way — wind or flood., What we’ll see here over the next 24 hours is going to tell us which one we’re going to face.  We’re planning for all those eventualities.  I guess maybe worst-case scenario is if it dips down, moves west, and curls around to the other side of the state.  Because right now, it’s my belief that people haven’t been planning for that.  I want to make sure — I’m not suggesting that that’s going to happen, but it seems to be within the cone of uncertainty., And so this storm, at this point, could do everything from Tampa to Jacksonville and a direct hit on Miami.  So please plan for those things accordingly.  Don’t necessarily evacuate based on those eventualities.  Listen to your local officials as they’re tracking it most closely.  But do prepare to be in the storm’s path just in case.  So that’s how we’re doing it., And then lastly, to answer your question, Major, what we’re doing is instead of prepositioning all the commodities in places that might be affected by the storm, to continue support operations to the islands.  The FEMA logistics team have thought through placing those supplies elsewhere, even up to Delaware and New York and elsewhere, so they continue barge operations and to support the islands, and that the next storm doesn’t affect the storm before — if that answers your question., So I can go here., Q    The big question is, after the chemical fire that occurred in Texas, and the fact that you all are being taxed with a second storm, are there any extra precautions that are being taken from this time to ensure that that type of thing doesn’t happen here?  And how taxed is the system for this and for Jose coming in?, MR. BOSSERT:  Well, the system can be taxed in different ways.  I addressed already the lifesaving, life-sustaining operational capabilities that we have, all the USAR teams and so forth which are martialed by the federal government but provided by the states.  They’re all rested and refit and ready to come back into the fight.  Same with the Coast Guard and United States Military National Guard and Title 10 forces., We’re preparing for environmental losses, as we should.  I can’t speak to each and every company’s preparation efforts.  As I stand here, we can continue to monitor that and follow up with you.  There will be steps that are taken, from setting down the nuclear power facility to a position of safety.  I think they take some kind of warm shutdown posture at some point, depending on the track.  So we monitor those things.  I was comfortable with the position of most of them.  But also look at Okeechobee, because that’s going to be a big flooding risk and an overflow risk., Q    Is there anything that you’re not comfortable with right now that is an overriding concern?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, well, we’re worried about the fuel shortages.  We’re worried about whatever worries the governor at this point.  But no, to be honest with you, I am setting expectations appropriately here, because as we go through a storm, nobody is ever happy or completely safe.  But I am extremely comfortable with the government efforts.  Now I want to make sure that people understand that they have a part to play here as well., Q    I have two questions for you if you don’t mind.  Number one, taking a step back and looking a little more big picture, you’ve got wildfires out west, you’ve got the crisis in Texas that people are still recovering from, you have Irma, Jose on its heels.  The resources of the federal government are not unlimited.  At what point do you worry that the resources are being stretched too thin, if you’re not at the point now?, MR. BOSSERT:  No, I don’t — as the Chief of Staff, General Kelly, says, the federal government should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.  He’s absolutely right.  We’ve had Cabinet meetings here today, yesterday, and throughout these storm events focusing on efforts and national security matters around the globe., So I’m pretty comfortable in our ability and our capacity as leaders, but also as institutions to handle the various different things that come our way.  I’m extremely comfortable with President Trump’s capacity to do so.  He’s demonstrated an ability to juggle these issues of complexity on a regular basis, including today., What I do worry about are the financial resources.  Congress came and stepped up in a bipartisan way.  I think President Trump deserves a lot of credit for putting that together over the last 48 hours.  And they have done what the American people really want them to do, and that is act and do what’s right instead of quibbling over things that tend to get in the way of efficient execution of services., And so in this particular case, we’re going to have to go back, I’m sure, for additional resources as these storms continue to hurt our states and our citizens.  But for now, we’re taking a responsible course of action, asking for the money in the appropriate small tranches, and then reassessing and getting better estimates so that we don’t overestimate.  But we’re not doing it in a way that’s going to stop or slow down operations., Q    And my second question — and actually, do you know what a number would be on that yet, or is it too early?, MR. BOSSERT:  On a subsequent request?  No, a little too early.  So as you know, the approximately $7.5 billion that came for FEMA on the supplemental was a calculated estimate.  There’s a $6.8 billion figure, roundabout, that would be a regular scheduled replenishment at the end of the month for FEMA’s disaster relief fund.  Those two together were contemplated.  So we assume passage of both.  The third, or future, request will be based on estimates of information as we refine them., Q    And while we have you here — I know you’re here to focus on Irma, but I’ve got to ask about DACA because there’s still a question of what happens to DACA recipients currently serving in the military.  There’s still no decision.  Can you explain why there’s a delay in explaining to these folks what’s going to happen and when they might be able to expect an answer?, MR. BOSSERT:  No, I can’t.  I can tell you that the President put it back on Congress and then asked for his priorities to be met and their solution., Q    But in the interim window?, MR. BOSSERT:  In the interim window, I’m not sure, to be honest with you, what the answer is on the military part of DACA.  But I thought we were clear.  I’ll find and make sure I get back to you on that., Q    Tom, given Harvey and the flooding and the recovery efforts that you talked about, and then what may happen with Irma, there have been reports that you all are reconsidering the flood — reversing the floodplain regulations that the Obama administration put in.  Can you talk about whether you are, in fact, reconsidering that — either putting back those regulations or drafting new regulations that would once again toughen back up the flood regulations given that we’re going to facing a lot of those issues as both of these places recover?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, no, I won’t necessarily accept the premise of the question, but I will answer the spirit of it.  So it’s not about tough or not tough, it’s about smart or not smart.  And I think the answer here — I think I went out and did this in one of your publications — the answer here is that we shouldn’t use federal money to rebuild in ways that don’t anticipate future flood risk.  So we need to build back smarter and stronger against floodplain concerns when we use federal dollars., What happened in the President’s infrastructure executive order was the rescission of an Obama-era order that had a broad-ranging and overreaching scope into construction permitting.  And at the time that we rescinded it, we did so in the hope of expediting infrastructure development in this country, which I think was a smart move, for what it’s worth.  The President certainly did as well., But now what we have to do is replace with thoughtful — whether it’s an executive order, regulations, or both — building standards and practices for the expenditure of federal money that makes floodplain and risk-mitigation sense., Q    But there will be some kind of affirmative effort to —, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah.  In the interim, I should point out two things here, right?  Not to be defensive, but first, that Obama-era executive order had not turned into a regulation yet.  So nothing in this storm would have changed, whether we acted or didn’t act, if that makes sense.  So this was not an immediate or poorly thought-through step., And then secondly, whether we put forward an executive order or not, we do have the latitude, under the current Stafford Act authorities and other laws to put into these rebuilding practices in Texas and Florida appropriate floodplain management practices.  But we want to make sure we think through how to codify that for the future in the next month., Ma’am., Q    Tom, on Monday, we’re seeing an anniversary — 9/11 — and the nation right now is seeing a lot of vulnerabilities, speaking (inaudible).  What is the threat level?  And what is this administration doing as it relates to moving into this tragic anniversary — remembering this tragic anniversary?, MR. BOSSERT:  Well, I was kind of personally motivated into service on that day.  And that’s why I’ve come back to service here again.  The counterterrorism mission is the one I take the most seriously.  And President Trump will, as Presidents before him and since 9/11, receive a comprehensive picture of the terrorist threat environment and what we’re doing to counter it from his senior officials on 9/11 — or I think on Monday we’ll do this; we’ll get the timing of that to you and we’ll give you a readout., He’ll do that; that’s a practice that we’ve started since 9/11.  And Presidents Bush and Obama maintained that practice.  President Trump intends to do the same.  And then I’ll let the team announce his planned event for — or scheduled events for attending any ceremonies and paying some respects.  But for the most part, I’d encourage the administration — who will, I’m sure, fan out and give appropriate speeches — to show some solemnity that day and not talk too much about policy.  It’s a day of remembrance and respect., Q    What’s the threat level right now as we go into 9/11 and with the vulnerabilities that we are seeing throughout this nation?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, no terrorist should view us as vulnerable right now — farthest thing from the truth, okay?  Second, there is no actionable credible threat to the United States right now.  We’ve run those regular risk-posture meetings here at the White House, and we bring together the entirety of the intelligence community when we do so.  There is no current, credible, actionable threat — terrorist threat — against the homeland.  But we will continue to track that, and if we learn of such a thing, we communicate it to our law enforcement authorities and to the public as soon as we learn it., Q    In addition to the issue of supplies of oil and gas, there’s the issue of price, and gasoline has jacked up about 70 cents a gallon.  I remember in an earlier briefing, you said you would be monitoring to make sure there isn’t gouging.  Are you monitoring beyond the issue of supply and demand?  It does seem to be a pretty bad excuse just to raise prices.  And to make sure that it’s data-based?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, so the idea is trying to determine — it’s a fact-based determination — the difference between gouging and supply-and-demand price indicators.  So I’d ask you to remember one thing:  that refineries, at least five or six of them in Houston, are still down.  So we’ve got a refinery issue on one side, and we’ve got an increased demand issue on the other side.  And so that’s necessarily, generally, going to raise prices, but it’s a short-term price spike in our experience.  We’ll try to differentiate that from gouging as we examine any potential allegations of that practice., But for right now, Floridians are pretty well used to this, and I think they’re pretty well used to their Attorney General prosecuting them in Florida.  So I’m not of the opinion that I have to issue too many warnings from this podium again, but in case anybody missed me last time, gouging won’t be tolerated, period — period.  Okay?, Let me see if I can come back real quickly, because I know Sarah is here and has a lot more to do.  Governor Mapp, Governor Rosello, Governor McMaster of South Carolina, Scott of Florida, Deal of Georgia, and Abbott or Texas — you’re all on our minds.  You’re all our clients.  You’re our customer base right now.  You’re going to set the requirements, we’re going to meet those requirements.  And as Americans, we’re going to get through this., \\nSo remember, I started with inform, influence, and inspire.  I’m pretty certain that the country saw the people of Texas show us what compassion is all about, and I’m pretty sure the Floridians and South Carolinians are going to step up and match that challenge in the next coming days.  Let’s say a little prayer for them, and I’ll come back out and speak to you as the situation dictates., So thank you very much.  Appreciate it., MS. SANDERS:  Thank you, Tom., As you can see, the safety and security of the American people is the President’s top priority, and we’ll continue to work with our local partners to keep the public fully informed as the events unfold., Looking ahead to this weekend, the President and the First Lady will be hosting Cabinet members and their spouses at Camp David.  This will be a working weekend, which will include the fourth Cabinet meeting since the President took office.  That will take place on Saturday.  The President will lead a discussion on the administration’s priorities, in addition to receiving briefings on Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts and preparations for Hurricane Irma., Secretary Mattis will obviously be among the Cabinet members attending this weekend.  And on a lighter note, today happens to be his birthday.  So I’d like to wish Secretary Mattis a happy birthday on behalf of all of us here., Everybody knows I love a good birthday story.  In a letter to his troops in the field in 2003, General Mattis encouraged them to fight with a happy heart and a strong spirit, and to demonstrate to the world that there is no better friend and no worse enemy than a U.S. Marine.  I think it’s safe to say that he has lived his own life by that advice.  And, General, we hope you’re 67th birthday is a good one., With that, I’ll take your questions.  Cecilia., Q    Is this agreement with the Democrats that the President reached a one-off?  Is this something we can expect to see more of — bipartisanship from this White House?, MS. SANDERS:  I certainly think that the goal is to have bipartisan efforts and certainly legislation where you’ve got Republicans and Democrats both working towards it.  That was something that the President talked about during the campaign, and certainly something that I think the American people expect, and one of the reasons they voted for him.  And I certainly would expect to continue to see that., Q    Does the President care at all that Republican leadership is annoyed with this deal that he reached?, MS. SANDERS:  I think that the President’s focus was doing what was best for the American people, and that’s why he’s the President.  The people wanted somebody to be a leader, they wanted somebody that was going to step up and take action and get things done, and that’s exactly what the President did., I think the last thing we want to do is play partisan politics when we have people in places like Texas and Louisiana that need financial support through the federal government.  The President wanted to make sure that happened and that that got taken care, and that’s what he did., John., Q    Sarah, what’s the thinking behind the President working with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to eliminate the need to constantly go through this debt ceiling process?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think that if you can take some of that partisan bickering out of the process, that’s probably a good thing.  This is a government that is always going to pay its debts and wants to make sure that our bills get paid and that we can support the needs that we have of our country, like we’re having to do right now in a time of disaster relief efforts.  And so that’s certainly a priority moving forward., Q    But there’s some conservatives in Congress who say taking away the battles over the debt ceiling just means that you’re going to continue to add on debt, add on debt, add on debt, with no checks and balances., MS. SANDERS:  Well, I think that’s if you have your priorities wrong.  The President is focused on, one, balancing the budget, bringing that debt down overall, but also making sure, again, that the citizens of our country, particularly those in a really desperate time of need, like we are seeing right now in Texas and Louisiana, are taken care of., Major., Q    Sarah, about tomorrow — you said it’s important for the public to be fully informed.  I would just suggest you take in due seriousness having the pool be able to cover some portion of that Cabinet meeting at Camp David tomorrow so the country can be fully informed., MS. SANDERS:  We will be releasing some of the President’s remarks from tomorrow and we’ll keep you guys posted on that process and how that will work., Q    In this regard, you talked about eliminating partisan bickering from the debt-ceiling process.  Is that a Republican problem?, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 11:12 A.M. EDT, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Good morning.  I wanted to make a brief statement before we start about things that are probably more important than the numbers.  And folks like me sometimes get caught up in the numbers.  I want to talk very briefly about what happened in Manchester, England., The President this morning summed it up emotionally for a lot of us who just called these people who perpetrated this — the one person, there may be more — “evil losers.”  The President has — I think Barron is 11 or 12.  I took my son to his first concert when he was 11 or 12.  And I think all of us who have children that age and take them to concerts, this is something that hits especially close to home., And we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our ally and our friends in the UK, and also have the victims and their families in our hearts as we talk about these other things that somehow pale in comparison., With that said, let’s talk about the budget.  And I know that some of you were here yesterday, and some of what I’ll say at the opening will be a repeat.  But a lot of folks were not here.  So let’s talk about what this is., This is the President’s FY2018 Budget.  The name on the cover is “The New Foundation for American Greatness.”  As I read through it over the weekend, as I did — in fact, we’ve been working on this since before I actually got here — it struck me that the title should have been different; that the title should have been, “A Taxpayer First Budget.”  Because that’s what this is., And as I was trying to reconcile those two things — well, it’s called the “New Foundation for American Greatness,” but I wanted to call it the “Taxpayer First Budget,” that it struck me that that was what was really new, or one of the things that was new about this budget; that we looked at this budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the bills., I think for years and years we’ve simply looked at a budget in terms of the folks who are on the back end of the programs, the recipients of the taxpayer money, and we haven’t spent nearly enough time focusing our attention on the people who pay the taxes., I got a couple questions yesterday — I know I will today — about compassion.  Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation.  Yes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it.  And that is one of the things that is new about this President’s budget., What else is new?  It’s new in that it balances for the first time in at least 10 years.  The last time we looked, we couldn’t find a President Obama budget that balanced ever.  I think he tried a couple times to convince us that primary balance, which was balance without regard for interest payments on the debt, was balanced.  We reject that.  We get to an actual balance on this budget within the 10-year window., It begins to reduce the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy in year one, okay?  That’s how important it was and is to this President to try and bring some fiscal discipline., Again, if you’re looking through the perspective of the people who pay, you’d like to be able to tell them at some point in the foreseeable future, you’re going to be able to balance.  The previous administration completely gave up on that.  As I’ve said before, to the previous administration, if you borrow money — if I take money from you and I have no intention of ever giving it back, that is not debt.  That is theft., And if we’re going to borrow money from people, we have to have a plan for how we are going to pay it back.  And that’s what this budget does, and that’s one of the things that is new about this budget., The next word in the title is foundation.  What is the foundation that we’re trying to build here?  And I sum it up this way — again, I saw an article a couple weeks ago about “What is Trumponomics?” and that Trumponomics is part of the foundation here.  What is it?  It’s sustained, 3 percent economic growth., Everything that we do in this administration, every single time I am called into the Oval Office — whether it’s on immigration policy, healthcare policy, tax reform policy, trade policy, budgets and spending — the focus is sustained, 3 percent economic growth., We have been attacked, stunningly, by some folks on the left and even in the mainstream who say that that’s an unreasonable assumption.  We should stop and think how absurd that is to think that 3 percent growth in an American economy is to some people an absurd assumption.  It used to be normal.  Ten years ago it was normal.  In fact, it’s been normal for the history of the country.  I think the average over the 240-odd years that we’ve been a country has been over 3 percent.  It’s certainly been over 3 percent since World War II., The 1.9 percent growth rates that the previous administration assumed towards the end of their administration, and the 1.9 percent growth rates for the entire 10-year window that the CBO growth rates assume — that the CBO assumes, the Congressional Budget Office assumes, are something we simply reject.  That is a pessimistic look at what the potential for this country and for what this country’s people is.  We reject that pessimism., And so you know what?  We probably should have gone in and assumed 3.5 percent or 4 percent growth because that would be aggressive.  Three percent growth is just getting back to normal., I’ve said it before, I say it again:  If you are 30 years old and you are watching this, or you’re sitting here, you have never had a job as an adult in a healthy American economy.  It’s either been a recession or a slow, sluggish economy stumbling along at less than 2 percent growth., The differences between 2 percent growth and 3 percent growth doesn’t sound like much.  In fact, I cringe when I hear people say it’s only a 1 percent difference.  It’s not; it’s a 50 percent difference.  But that’s just math.  The difference in that is tangible., At 3 percent economic growth in a healthy American economy, if you don’t like your job, you can quit because you know you can go get another job.  If you get laid off, you know you can go off and start your own business.  These are the opportunities that people have forgotten about.  And these are the things, the optimism in the country, the dynamism in the country that the President is so eager to push back and to bring back to the country., It’s what drives every one of our policies, especially when it comes to anything dealing with jobs and the economy.  We will bring back 3 percent economic growth to this country, and those numbers are assumed in this budget., By the way, if you don’t, the budget will never balance.  If you assume 1.9 percent growth, my guess is you’ll never see a balanced budget again.  So we refuse to accept that that’s the new normal in this country.  Three percent is the old normal.  Three percent will be the new normal again under the Trump administration.  And that is, part and parcel, one of the foundations of this budget., Along those same lines, the budget also speaks to and funds a lot of the President’s priorities.  We’ve talked about this since March when we unveiled the budget blueprint.  National security, obviously a priority for this President.  Border security another priority for him.  We can talk at length, if you want today, about the details of the additional money that we spend in those areas., The total plus-up, again, for the 2018 budget is $54 billion over the Congressional Budget Office baseline.  The law enforcement gets a significant increase here, and that’s both at the federal and the state and local level as we follow through on our efforts to enforce the law., Veterans see more money here.  That’s a classic example of looking at the budget through the eyes of the taxpayer.  I put myself in the role of the person who is actually taking the money from you as taxpayer and giving the money to someone else in terms of a benefit.  And if I can look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you so that I can help this injured vet, I can do that in good conscience — I can look you in the eye, and my guess is you’re okay with that — I am a lot less comfortable to the point of not wanting to look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you to give to this person over here who really isn’t disabled but is getting a disabled benefit, or this person over here who is supposed to use the money to go to school, but isn’t actually going, or a program that is supposed to encourage you to graduate from high school — or from college, but is only 6 percent effective., That’s the type of compassion we talk about, and that’s the type of different perspective that we bring to the budget.  And it’s one of the things that I like to talk about when we talk about the veterans.  People don’t mind paying their taxes as long as they know that that money is not being wasted and frittered away., We also increase spending for school choice and paid parental leave, making this President the first President of either party to propose a nationwide paid parental leave program for parents and adopted parents.  There’s $20 billion in that over the course of the 10-year window.  I think I gave an incorrect number yesterday of $25 billion., What are those, by the way?  National security, border security, law enforcement, veterans, school choice, paid parental leave.  They are all — all — campaign promises that the President made while he was running for office., And that’s why I say these numbers are simply the President’s policies put onto paper.  We took the President’s speeches, we took his priorities.  We turned them into numbers, and that’s what it’s in the document., It does not — along the same lines, not a single thing in here touches Social Security retirement or Medicare.  Why?  Because that’s what the President said when he was campaigning, that he would not change those things., In fact, I’ve told the story several times of sitting in the President’s office with a list of possible reforms to mandatory — what some people call entitlement spending — and have the President at the end of the list go:  Yes, yes, no, no, no, no.  And the “no, no, no’s” were always Social Security retirement and Medicare.  Didn’t change those at all because he promised people that he wouldn’t., We can do all that and balance at the same time because we look at spending differently.  We’re no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those programs.  We’re not going to measure compassion by the amount of money that we spend, but by the number of people that we help., And that is how you can get 3 percent economic growth.  That is how you can balance the budget in 10 years.  That is how you can borrow money from people while still promising and intending to pay it back from them.  That is how you can help people take charge of their own lives again, and that is the part of the budget that deals with the American greatness., So with that, I’ll take questions for a little bit.  I know there is a couple.  Yes, ma’am., Q    So President Trump is sticking to his campaign promise not to touch Medicare or Social Security retirement benefits, but not Medicaid.  So how does he intend to square that with his supporters?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  A couple things about Medicaid, and this is one of my favorite stories to tell about Washington spending.  Keeping in mind — and I know that you all probably get this, but if you’re watching this at home — in Washington, D.C., if you spent $100 last year on something, and we spend $100 on it this year — on that same thing — in Washington, people call that a cut.  $100 last year, $100 this year — you all call it a cut., In fact, I’ve seen several occasions where we’ve spent $100 last year, and $102 this year, and many people will still call that a cut — because the budget is hard-wired by the Congressional Budget Office to go up every single year.  And if the Congressional Budget Office says we spent $100 last year, and we’re supposed to spend $106 this year, for a lot of people anything less than $107 is a cut.  In fact, I’ve actually heard $106 referred to as a “freeze” because it simply says in line with the Congressional Budget Office.  A classic example of how Washington speaks differently than the world back home., So a couple things about Medicaid, okay?  There are no Medicaid cuts in the terms of what ordinary human beings would refer to as a cut.  We are not spending less money one year than we spent before.  What we are doing is growing Medicaid more slowly over the 10-year budget window than the Congressional Budget Office says that we should or says that we will under current law., Why do we change it?  We change it — we change those growth rates in Medicaid spending because of the American Health Care Act, which this President does support.  We’ve said from the very beginning we support the House efforts.  We’re looking forward to and are working right now with the Senate, working on what their healthcare bill would look like.  But we support the American Health Care Act, and that does change Medicaid., How does it change it?  And this is something that I don’t think enough people are talking about.  It makes it a lot better and a lot more able to deliver the necessary services to the people who need it.  Here’s how:  Medicaid is funded in large part by the states.  In fact, I was in the state legislature, and our second-largest line item I think after K-12 education was Medicaid.  And we would see this program come down from Washington will all of these instructions on how to use it, and say, goodness gracious, this won’t work in South Carolina., We happen to think, for example, that Medicaid is designed for more of an urban poor population than a rural poor, as predominates in South Carolina.  And we would ask them every single year — would ask them, the federal government — give us more control over how this money gets spent.  We think we can do it better.  We think we can either provide the same services to the same number of people cheaper, or we can provide better service to more people at the same amount of money if you let us do it better.  And the federal government always said no.  In the American Health Care Act, we say yes, and we give the governors and the state legislatures a lot more control over Medicaid., Everyone is interested in seeing the truly needy in their state and in our nation get the care that we promised them in Medicaid.  But there’s a better way to do it than under current law, which is Obamacare.  We can also talk about what a failure that is.  But there’s a better way to do it, and that’s what the American Health Care Act does., In the back.  Yes, sir., Q    Director Mulvaney, you mentioned the previous administration, the stagnant growth, and that the deficit has actually doubled since 2008 from about $10 trillion to $20 trillion.  But a member of that administration, Larry Summers, today actually went on the attack.  I’m curious, how do you respond to his assessment of the budget?  He called it “simply ludicrous,” and that the administration is double-counting the tax cut and the benefit from the growth., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I did get a chance to just see the piece that Mr. Summers wrote, on the way out the door, and the ideas were rushing into my head what I might say to Larry if he were here.  So if he’s hiding in the back, now would be a good time for him to come out and identify himself., I went back and looked at some of the economic assumptions that the Obama administration made in its first couple of years, and I want to say, on a couple of different occasions, their assumed growth rate was more than 4.5 percent.  Keep in mind this is the first administration in history — it was the first decade and the first eight-year period of history not to have a 3 percent growth rate, and yet they were promising us 4.5 percent growth.  So if Larry wants to talk about unreasonable assumptions, we talk about my 3 percent growth rate and his 4.5, and we’ll talk about who actually is closer to reality., Regarding the double-counting, here’s one of the things I think that a lot of folks have overlooked.  And we did it on purpose because it’s sort of hard to count this, and you don’t want to make too many assumptions.  You have to make assumptions about a budget.  You’re talking about a document that will look 10 years into the future.  So it’s natural for administrations from either party to make some assumptions., But one of the assumptions we didn’t make was that we didn’t close any of the tax gap.  For those of you who aren’t familiar with that, the tax gap is the amount of money that we should collect in taxes every single year, but don’t.  2016 — that number is $486 billion.  Almost enough to close the deficit that year.  And we don’t assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform.  Why is that important?  There’s probably two reasons that people — well, three reasons people don’t want to pay tax.  Number one, they just don’t pay tax, and there’s always a certain number of people who don’t want to do that.  Number two, it’s just too hard for them to do it.  It’s too complicated for them to do it.  Two reasons.  Now I feel like I’m a Monty Python skits.  But two reasons., And we think that —, Q    Airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Exactly.  That if it’s a simpler tax code, that people are more likely to pay.  That simply makes sense.  If you can really fill out your tax reform — tax returns on a single piece of paper, you’re much more likely to actually do it.  It’s also easier for us to see if you’re paying the right amount.  A simpler code is easy for you to pay and easy for the government to see if you’re paying the right amount, which would allow us very reasonably to assume a reduction in the tax gap.  And we don’t do a single penny of that., So I’m aware of the criticisms, and I would simply come back and say, look, there’s other places where we were probably overly conservative in our accounting.  We stand by the numbers.  We thought that the assumption that the tax reform would be deficit-neutral was the most reasonable of the three options that we had.  We could either assume that our tax reform was deficit-neutral.  We could assume it would reduce the deficit.  We would assume it would add to the deficit.  And given the fact that we’re this early in the process about dealing with tax reform, we thought that assuming that middle road was the best way to do it., Yes, sir., Q    Thank you, Director.  Can you characterize the treatment of climate science programs and cuts to those?  And do you describe those as a taxpayer waste, if you do not cut them?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  You tell me.  I think the National Science Foundation last year used your taxpayer money to fund a climate change musical.  Do you think that’s a waste of your money?, Q    What about climate science?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I’ll take that as a yes, by the way.  (Laughter.), So you see my point.  What I think you saw happened during the previous administration is the pendulum went too far to one side, where we were spending too much of your money on climate change and not very efficiently.  We don’t get rid of it here.  Do we target it?  Sure.  Do a lot of the EPA reductions aimed at reducing the focus on climate science?  Yes.  Does it meant that we are anti-science?  Absolutely not.  We’re simply trying to get things back in order to where we can look at the folks who pay the taxes, and say, look, yeah, we want to do some climate science, but we’re not going to do some of the crazy stuff the previous administration did., And I will note for the record that you didn’t say anything about the musical., Yes, ma’am., Q    Thank you, Director.  I’m just wondering — you were talking about making assumptions.  What are your assumptions and expectations for the budget in reference to the wall?  I mean, Congress really seems to have come on the record and say they’re not in support of funding it.  So what are you expectations?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Well, some folks aren’t in support of it, some folks are very much in support of it., By the way, I did read something — and I was really disappointed yesterday.  I don’t know if there’s anybody here from the folks who broke the embargo.  But I thought — there was only place — I don’t think it was anybody here.  Somebody did.  But I read the article about how we supposedly dramatically reduced our request for the wall funding.  It’s not accurate.  The 2017 request was $1.5 billion for border security and $3 billion in additional DHS funding.  And the request in the — the proposal in the 2018 is $2.6 billion for border security — almost twice as much — and $4.5 billion for total DHS.  Again, a much larger number than 2017.  So I’m not really sure how the person got to that number., But let me address your question., Q    (Inaudible) the wall —, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  It was.  We are absolutely dead serious about the wall.  In fact, after taking care of national security and the vets, my guess is, it’s in the President’s top three.  In fact, I know for a fact that it is.  And we’ve made that very clear to the folks on the Hill that while we did not get as much money as we wanted for border security in the 2017 omnibus — we didn’t get a lot; many of you were here for the presentation I gave on that — that we will see increased border security between today and the end of the calendar year.  By the same token, we’re going to continue to press on., We do think there’s a role for technology, a role for additional people, all of which we asked for in this 2018 budget request.  But it is absolutely a priority for the President., Yes, sir., Q    You said you reject the premise of the economy not growing at 3 percent., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Yep., Q    Did you set the 3 percent target and then reverse-engineer the figures in order to achieve that?  Give us the math?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  No.  Yeah, keep in mind, we had — because there was a lot of numbers that were floated during the campaign — 3 percent, 3.5 percent, 4 percent, 4.5 percent — and we didn’t start with any of those numbers and work back.  What we sat down and did is this — in fact, it was the group of — it was myself, Secretary Mnuchin, Director Cohn from the NEC, who at the time I think was — still is playing the filling the role often filled by the Council of Economic Advisers.  And what we did is we sat down and said — we looked at the CBO baseline numbers and said, okay, what will our tax policy increase GDP by?  What are the ranges for that?  What will our regulatory policy impact GDP by?  And what could the ranges be for that?  What does repealing Obamacare do for increasing GDP?, By the way, the Congressional Budget Office actually has hard numbers on that.  The Congressional Budget Office assumes that if your repeal Obamacare, it will increase GDP because Obamacare creates a disincentive to work., So we went through the methodology, item by item, and arrived at the 3 percent.  And I also think that you’ll see that, as well, in the ramp-up to that 3 percent.  We don’t assume 3 percent in year one, for example.  I think the assumption for this year is 2.3 percent, then 2.5 percent, then 2.7 percent or 2.8 percent, and then 3 percent out.  So we think it’s a very reasonable and very defensible macroeconomic assumption., Digging a little bit deeper into the numbers, we also think that our numbers regarding the related interest rates and unemployment rates are likewise defensible.  We get a lot of questions, sometimes, about productivity.  We hear these stories now — there was an interesting story in one of the leading newspapers — I can’t remember if was the Times or the Post, yesterday — about a business in Utah that can’t find enough people to work.  And people say, oh, how are you going to grow the economy at 3 percent if we’re already facing a tight employment market?, I’m going to pull the numbers up here to I don’t butcher these.  Of course, as soon as I say that, I can’t pull the numbers up.  The difference between the U6 rate and the U3 rate is — I think the number was in excess of 6 million people.  What does that mean?  The U3 rate is what we call the unemployment rate.  It’s what everybody calls the unemployment rate.  The U6 rate is those folks who are unemployed — they’re in the labor force looking for work but they can’t find it — plus the people who are marginally attached or are working part-time for economic reasons, working part-time because they can’t find full-time work.  That difference, that delta, is over 6 million people.  So we believe that we should be able to drive U3 and U6 together and get those folks into full-time employment.  And that’s one of the ways you get productivity gains., Q    You’re saying that U6, a measure that goes back to 1994, you can have it equal to U3 measure?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  In a properly functioning economy, that would be the case.  Because keep in mind, what’s the difference?  Marginally attached and part-time against your will.  You want to work full-time, but you’re not.  So you’re technically not unemployed, because that’s not the technical definition of the U3 unemployment rate, but you want to be doing more, you want to be more productive, to go back to the economic terms.  And we do believe that if we bring those people back to the job place, they will end up adding to productivity., Q    Director Mulvaney, thanks for doing this.  On the day that he came down the escalator, famously, and became candidate Trump, he said, “We’re going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.  Have to do it.”  I recognize that he’s going to be saving Social Security retirement, but he’s not saving Social Security disability insurance, which benefits more than 10 million Americans.  So is the President keeping his promise on that program?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Thank you for that.  Yes, he absolutely is.  And here’s why.  The fact that it’s called Social Security disability insurance I think is — well, I’ll put it to you this way.  We propose to do parental paid leave in this budget.  Again, the first President of either party to do that.  We propose to do that using the tools that already exist through the state unemployment insurance.  By the way, I think that’s similar to the way that Canada does it now., There are a couple of states — New York, New Jersey, I think California — who already provide statewide paid parental leave.  They do it through their disability insurance programs, their employment disability.  That does not mean that parental leave is unemployment, and it does not mean that parental leave is a disability. It simply means that that program is managed through the infrastructure that already existed at the time it was set up., And the same is true with Social Security disability.  It is a welfare program for the long-term disabled.  It is not what most people would consider to be Social Security., Q    So why do those individuals who presently receive SSDI receive less as a result of this budget?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I hope so — if there are people who are getting SSDI who should not be getting it —, Q    Those people who should be getting, will they receive less?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  No, no, if people are really disabled and there are folks who need this program —, Q    So how are you going to determine who is getting it that shouldn’t be getting it?  So many antifraud programs that exist already., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Yes, that’s a great question, and I could get down in the weeds.  But one of the — we have — one of the proposals we have is actually how we pick the administrative law judges to make — because I think it’s a lifetime appointment on day one, and we try to phase them in to make sure that they’re not — there have been several judges accused of sort of abusing the program., But to your point — your point is an excellent one — we are not kicking anybody off of any program who really needs it.  That’s not — we have plenty of money in this country to take care of the people who need help.  Okay?  And we will do that.  We don’t have enough money to take care of people, everybody who doesn’t need help.  So what we try and do is look at these programs — again, through the perspective of the people paying for it — and say, SNAP, for example — I know I haven’t been asked a question about it —, Q    But wouldn’t 42 million Americans benefit from SNAP?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  42 million Americans?  I thought it was 44; I’ll take your word for it on 42., Q    It’s in the neighborhood., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  It is.  I think the high was 47, and that was during the recession.  Pre-recession, the numbers were as 28.  It spiked during the recession, which you would expect on a countercyclical program like food stamps.  During bad economic times, more people will go onto food stamps.  So it’s completely within reason to look at that number — it went from 28 million on food stamps before the recession to 47 million at the height. It’s 44 or 42 today.  Yet here we are, eight years removed from the end of the recession.  We’ve had economic growth, albeit slow.  We’re at what we consider to be full employment, with the limitations of U3 and U6.  Why is the number still that high?, Is it possible — if you’re paying for it, isn’t it reasonable for you to at least ask the question, are there people on that program who shouldn’t be on there?  And shouldn’t it be up to the government to make sure we can look folks who are paying the taxes in the eye and say, you know what, we did everything we could to make sure that everybody on SSDI is really disabled.  We don’t think that’s unreasonable.  In fact, we think that is the definition of compassionate — a compassion that is balanced between the people who get the benefits and the people who pay them., Yes, ma’am., Q    Can you talk about provisions affecting federal employees and how to strengthen — your plans to strengthen the federal government?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I’ll deal with federal — let’s talk about federal retirement, because that’s gotten a little bit of a — and that’s one of our largest changes.  Simply put, we try and make federal retirement closer — closer to the private sector.  So we’ve increased the contributions that they make to their 401(k) programs.  I think on one program we got rid of a cost-of-living adjustment that was there.  But keep in mind, those are folks who will also be participating in Social Security at the same time, which is cost-of-living adjusted.  So we thought they were common-sense reforms to try and bring the federal government benefit programs closer to the private sector., I’m a federal worker.  I have a pension and a 401(k).  Raise your hand if you’re in the private sector and you have a pension and a 401(k).  My guess is — oh, one did.  Did you really?  In the back?  Okay, all right.  So she wanted to ask the next question.  So we’re simply trying to get some common sense back into that program.  And we don’t think that’s an unreasonable thing to do.  Again, it’s the right thing to do on behalf of the taxpayers., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:13 P.M. EDT, MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  I want to thank Sarah for standing in for me on Friday.  She did a great job.  I missed you all tremendously.  (Laughter.)  Now that I realize that we can do that a little more I’ll spend a little more time at the Pentagon., I moved this up a little bit — I appreciate your flexibility today so that the pool has enough time to cover the Vice President and Secretary Shulkin as they welcome Honor Flight our veterans to Washington on the anniversary of VA Day.  The Vice President is hosting more than 120 veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War as part of National Military Appreciation Month, and Public Service Recognition Week, highlighting the Trump administration’s commitment to our military and public service., Also today, the Vice President, Secretary Price, Secretary Shulkin all attended an event on the scientific opportunities in biomedicine.  Key leaders from government, the private sector and academia discussed the United States’ comprehensive biomedical landscape and further educated White House staff, including assistants to the President, Ivanka Trump and Reed Cordish, on this important topic., The meeting was organized by the National Institutes of Health and was led by its director, Dr. Francis Collins.  Leaders in the medical, education and research joined executives from companies who invest in biotech to provide analysis and real-life examples of how America’s sustained leadership in the biomedical industry has resulted in immeasurable benefits to both our country’s economic and physical well-being., Among the participants were Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Dr. Craig Thompson, the president of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Dr. Cornelia Bargmann, the president of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative;, \\nDr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, president of Stanford University; and Dr. Rick Lifton, the president of Rockefeller University., The United States currently sits atop the list of global investors in innovation in the life sciences, responsible for 44 percent of global research and development.  This investment is dependent on the NIH and the important research it funds.  In order to maintain our international leadership in biomedicine, we must strengthen the partnerships between government agencies, investors, academics, the bio-pharma industry and research foundations.  This meeting was an important step in reinforcing that essential cooperation., Moving on, I’m pleased to announce that today, shortly after this briefing, we will release a list of the President’s third wave of federal court nominees.  These 10 individuals that the President has chosen were chosen for their deep knowledge of the law and their commitment to upholding constitutional principles., Two of the nominees today came from the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that the President released during the campaign.  If confirmed, Justice Joan Larsen will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.  Justice Larsen is currently serving on the Michigan Supreme Court.  And Justice David Stras will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.  He currently serves as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court., The campaign list was put together from the Heritage Foundation, as well as the Federalist Society.  And as the President said last September when it was released, these “highly respected people are the kind of scholars that we need to preserve the very core of our country and make it greater than ever before.”  The President followed the principles that were used to guide that list to select the additional eight individuals.  And as I mentioned, the full list should be out very shortly., In terms of the President’s schedule for today, this morning he met with his National Security Advisor, General McMaster.  He also spoke with the French President-elect to congratulate him on his victory.  A readout of that call should be out very shortly.  The Prime Minister of Georgia was also at the White House, meeting with the Vice President.  The Prime Minister then dropped by with the Vice President into the Oval Office to greet the President.  And earlier this afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President., In about an hour, he’ll meet with Secretary of State Tillerson.  Secretary Tillerson has also been meeting with several foreign leaders today at the State Department, including the Prime Minister of Montenegro, the Foreign Minister of Slovakia, and the Foreign Minister of Qatar., Secretary Mattis is also meeting with many foreign leaders during his European trip this week to reaffirm key United States military alliances.  The Secretary is in Denmark to co-host a meeting with the Danish Minister of Defense, with senior leaders from 15 countries that are key contributors to the ISIS military campaign., While in Copenhagen, Secretary Mattis will also meet separately with the Minister of Defense to discuss European security and the importance of the NATO Alliance, and with the Danish Prime Minister to reaffirm the close ties between Denmark and the United States., In other Cabinet news, Secretary Zinke is in Utah today, continuing his four-day listening tour on the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, putting into action President Trump’s April 27th executive order to review these monuments.  Secretary Zinke will be accompanied by the governor and a number of Utah’s congressional delegation and local stakeholders for a morning aerial tour of the million-plus-acre monument and an afternoon hiking tour and a roundtable meeting this evening with Friends of Cedar Mesa Museum., While in Utah, the Secretary and other officials are holding daily press briefings on the ground.  You can reach out to the Interior Department for more details., And with that, I’d be glad to take a few questions., Kristen., Q    Sean, thank you.  Former President Obama warned then President-elect Trump against hiring Mike Flynn as his national security advisor.  Why did he ignore that?, MR. SPICER:  Well, the President doesn’t disclose details of meetings that he has, which, in this case, was an hour-long meeting.  But it’s true that the President made it — President Obama made it known that he wasn’t exactly a fan of General Flynn’s, which is, frankly, shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obama’s shortcomings, specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting ISIS and other threats around — that were facing America., So the question that you have to ask yourself really is, if President Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn why didn’t he suspend General Flynn’s security clearance, which they had just reapproved months earlier.  Additionally, why did the Obama administration let Flynn go to Russia for a paid speaking engagement, which he did? There were steps that they could have taken — if that was truly a concern, more than just a person that didn’t — had bad blood., Q    I want to follow up on a couple points, because you raised the security clearance.  But before that, if a sitting President raises the name of one individual, why wouldn’t that give the President-elect pause?  I understand what you’re saying, the caveat about the fact of the campaign, et cetera, but wouldn’t that give the incoming President pause?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think that — I don’t know that I agree with your characterization.  He made it clear that he wasn’t a fan of his, and I don’t think that should have come as a surprise considering the role that General Flynn played in the campaign, criticizing his —, Q    It didn’t give him any pause at all?, MR. SPICER:  No.  I think, again, I think if you know what we knew at the time, which is that the security clearance that he had had been reapproved in April of that year, and not only did they reapprove it, but then they took no steps to suspend it.  So the question has to be what did they do if they had real concerns beyond just not having — not liking him for some of the comments that he made., Q    And it’s our understanding — and if you could clarify this — did Mike Flynn not need an upgraded security clearance in order to serve as the national security advisor?, MR. SPICER:  He’d been head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  That’s the same —, Q    And you vetted him, as well, correct?, MR. SPICER:  That’s the same clearance that — the security clearance — we went over this a while ago — it’s the same clearance at any level.  Once you get it, you get it for the time you had — he had his reinvestigation in April of 2016, and the Obama administration took no steps — not only did they reaffirm that security clearance, they took no steps to suspend it or take any other action., Q    But did you not vet him yourselves?, MR. SPICER:  Well, you don’t vet — on a security clearance, that’s why you get a security clearance.  Everyone in the government goes through the same process.  So the answer is, is that those same — that same process worked for General Flynn as it did for me, or for anyone else who works here.  There’s no difference of a security clearance once it’s issued., Zeke., Q    What we do know is what we knew at the time.  So knowing what the White House knows now, does the White House, does the President think that General Flynn should not have had that clearance reissued last year, number one?   And number two, does the White House believe that General Flynn was truthful when he filled out his SF-86 for that reinvestigation last year?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I’m not going to get into those details.  Obviously, that was something that was adjudicated by the Obama administration in April of 2016.  They took no steps to suspend that.  So that’s not really a question for us; it’s a question for them at that time., Q    Knowing what you know now —, MR. SPICER:  I think the President took appropriate action when he did.  Once he felt as though General Flynn had misled the Vice President, he took appropriate action at the time, and he stands by that today., Q    His ties to Russia, and his work as a registered foreign agent now — registered foreign agent for the government of Turkey lead to his firing in February?, MR. SPICER:  Well, again, I don’t think we’re going to re-litigate this.  The President made the right decision back then and he stands by that., Hunter., Q    Thank you, Sean.  Last week, officials indicated that the Pentagon planned to send the President a proposal to send several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan.  Can you confirm whether or not the President has made a decision about sending additional troops to Afghanistan?  And if so, when are they going?  How many are going?  And what is their mission?, MR. SPICER:  I’ll refer you to the Department of Defense on that.  They are in contact with them.  But we have nothing to share at this time., Sara., Q    Thanks, Sean.  The President tweeted this morning that senators on the Intelligence Committee should ask Sally Yates about her role in classified leaks about General Flynn.  Does the President have evidence that ties Sally Yates to the Flynn leaks?  Why did he tweet that?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think you guys are well aware of the President’s concern about spills of classified and other sensitive information out into the open.  It’s something that should concern every American.  And the President has made it very clear since he took office that that’s a big concern of his.  And so the idea that classified information made its way into the press is something that I think, while we’re asking all of these questions, is one of the ones that I think the senators should ask — how did that information get out into the open like that.  I think that is an equally important question that, frankly, isn’t getting asked., Q    But does the President believe that Sally Yates was the leaker in this?, MR. SPICER:  Again, I think the tweet speaks for itself.  What he’s saying is that the Senate should ask those questions., Q    Sean, aside from the announcement today that the President will nominate 10 judges to fill federal vacancies, many conservatives remain concerned the White House is woefully behind on overall appointments.  The President recently told the Examiner — to paraphrase him — that he doesn’t need to fill vacant posts in the administration.  After these 10, there will still be 110 judicial vacancies.  Does the President still believe vacant administration jobs do not need to be filled?  And are there any plans to increase the pace of political appointments?, MR. SPICER:  So there’s like three questions in there.  I’ll try to break them down.  Number one, we have a very robust schedule of releasing names.  There is a method to this in terms of the nominees who are getting put out now, and I think you should expect to see more and more go through.  The process this time around is a little bit different.  We’re actually going through the Office of Government Ethics and FBI clearances before announcing most of these individuals.  And so there’s a little bit of a difference in how we’re doing this.  But we are well on pace with respect to many of these to get the government up and running., But the President’s point that he was making in that interview was that part of the review of government is to make sure that we’re looking at these positions and figuring out whether or not the taxpayer is getting the best bang for their buck both in terms of productivity and cost.  And so we’re looking through the entire government — Director Mulvaney I think briefed you all a while ago about how we look at government to figure out whether or not we can do a better job of filling positions, of staffing the government., But we’re going to continue to have announcements on key positions as this week goes by., Q    — bureaucracy if you don’t fill some of these —, MR. SPICER:  We are.  And that’s what I’m saying.  I think that you’re going to continue to see, whether it’s judicial nominations, ambassadors, other key positions — I think we have a very healthy clip of announcements that continue to go out., Q    Thanks, Sean.  Ahead of her testimony today, does President Trump believe Sally Yates is a trustworthy source of information?, MR. SPICER:  That’s not up for us to decide.  I mean, that is up to the Senate to decide whether or not what she does, and we’ll have to wait and see what that —, Q    And following up on Sara’s question, it seemed that the President was implying that Sally Yates may have had something to do with the leaked information to newspapers.  Is that what he was implying?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the tweet speaks for itself.  Sometimes you don’t have to read too much into it., Richard., Q    Thank you, Sean.  Two questions on NAFTA.  First, the Canadian Prime Minister, on Friday, said that they’re considering, as a reaction to what the Prime Minister calls an unfair, punitive duty on Canadian software lumber — considering banning coal imports from the U.S.  Is this the beginning of a trade war between Canada and the U.S.?, MR. SPICER:  No.  That’s why we have dispute settlement mechanisms, to do this in a responsible way.  Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary, has been in touch with his counterparts over there and I think — look, there’s a reason that the dispute mechanism is set up the way that it is under this particular trade agreement, but under most trade agreements, so that the two parties can resolve them in a way that allows for both sides to air their concerns.  But that’s why you have an agreement and that’s why you have a mechanism set up to do that., Q    So you trust the mechanism on this?, MR. SPICER:  No, no, let’s let it play out.  But I think Secretary Ross took appropriate action to protect the U.S. industry, and we’re going to let the process play out., Q    And 10 days ago, the President said that Mexico and Canada have agreed to fasten the process to renegotiate NAFTA.  What has happened in the last 10 days?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I thin, our officials will start to — we’ll have further updates for you on that.  Right now there is nothing to share., John., Q    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Did Sally Yates have to run any of her planned testimony by the General Counsel’s office that she’ll deliver later this afternoon?, MR. SPICER:  I’m not aware of it, no., Q    And also, do you have any reason to doubt that her testimony, which will be under oath, will be truthful before the Senate Subcommittee?, MR. SPICER:  No.  I would assume that when you raise your right hand and agree to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, that you’ll do that.  That’s the whole reason that you pledge., Francesca., Q    Thank you, Sean.  For weeks during the transition, President Trump was not receiving a daily intelligence briefing; he was receiving his information from General Flynn.  Do you think that lack of direct information from the intelligence community contributed to the lapse in vetting with General Flynn?, MR. SPICER:  So, first, he did get his — we extensively went over the PDB briefing throughout the campaign.  I believe back then it was three times a week that he was getting it, and, supplanted by his national security team, they would go in and do that.  So I think the premise is not there., Secondly, as I mentioned to Kristen, the processes that were followed by General Flynn are followed by every government employee who receives a clearance at that particular level., Q    On another thing, I wanted to talk about the signing statement that came out on Friday with the spending bill.  Senior administration officials, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, didn’t seem to know about that.  Why didn’t she or people working on that issue know about that, know it was coming?  Whose idea was that?  And what happened between when Sarah was out here on Friday saying that she didn’t think there was going to be something like that, and then close of business when there was a signing statement?  And did you know it was coming?, MR. SPICER:  So signing statements are a pro forma activity that occurs during a bill signing that’s performed by the Department of Justice Office of Legislative Counsel.  It’s been used by every President.  So I’m not really sure what everyone knew, but that is something that goes along, going back multiple administrations., Cecilia., Q    Can I follow with HBCUs, on that signing statement, please?, MR. SPICER:  Cecilia., Q    Thanks, Sean.  On the travel ban, a couple questions, if I may.  Back in February, the President said that lifting the travel ban would mean that many bad and dangerous people would be pouring in.  Have you seen any evidence that that’s been the case in the three months since this ban was lifted?, MR. SPICER:  I think that’s a question for the Department of Homeland Security., Q    Well, is that something you’ve been tracking?, MR. SPICER:  Personally, no, but I’d be glad to follow up with the Department of Homeland Security.  I don’t have anything at this time on that., Q    Okay.  In the same vein, if this White House is no longer calling this a “Muslim ban” as the President did initially, why does the President’s website still explicitly call for “preventing Muslim immigration”?  And it says, “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”, MR. SPICER:  I’m not aware of what’s on the campaign website.  You’d have to ask them.  I know how we’ve talked about this from the first day of this administration — as a travel a ban that’s in this country’s national security interest to make sure that the people who are coming in here are coming in here with the right motives.  The reasons that we’re having a public safety aspect to making sure that we’re protecting our people – I think that’s — we’ve been very consistent since the first day of this administration on this., Q    Is it worth standing here, though, and completely disavowing the use of that phrase, “Muslim ban”?  I mean, it’s still on the website.  If the President’s words are being used against him in court today, is it worth you clarifying that once and for all?, MR. SPICER:  I’m trying to figure out why — I’ve been very clear.  I don’t think I need to clarify what we have said or what the President said., Q    Well, it’s stuff that’s coming up in court.  And that’s expected to be —, MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And that’s, frankly, one of the reasons that we have concerns about how that’s being interpreted — because I think the intent of the travel ban was very clear.  I think it was something that the President made very clear in the filings that we have filed why he did it, the motives for doing it.  And he was very clear when he spoke about it from the beginning., So there really shouldn’t be any question as to why the President is doing this, and the idea of making sure that we’re putting the safety of our country and people first and foremost., Tamara., Q    Thank you.  I’ve got two topics, hopefully fast.  So the Kushner family was in China making a pitch for the EB-5 visa program.  This came a day after the President signed the omnibus, which of course extended that program without any changes.  So two questions on that.  One, is it a violation of the conflict of interest agreement that Jared Kushner came to?  And also, does the President believe that that investor visa program needs to be modified in any way?, MR. SPICER:  So I think I would refer you to the company on that.  Jared has done everything to comply with the ethics rules to make sure, and that had nothing to do with him, per se.  He wasn’t involved.  And secondly — I think we’ve talked about this before — the President and Congress are looking at how to look over the entire visa program, all the various visa programs, and whether or not they are serving the purpose that they were intended to, whether or not we’re making sure that we do what’s in the best interest of the American worker.  And so we’re going to continue to work with Congress on that., Q    And regarding the opioid commission, it’s my understanding that no members of that commission have been named yet.  We’re more than 30 days into what was supposed to be a 90-day period for that commission to come back with a report to the President.  What’s up with that?  And does that send the wrong signal to people who believe that this is a very urgent crisis, where like more than 100 people are dying every day?, MR. SPICER:  Right.  Well, let me get back to you on the exact names and the announcement on that.  I’ve got to follow with that.  I think when it comes to the opioid crisis, the President, both during the campaign, the transition, and now as President, has made it very clear of his commitment to figuring out how we can address this crisis that plagues so many neighborhoods and communities.  And he’ll continue to work with — you know, he appointed Governor Christie in a bipartisan commission.  So as soon as w, Q    Sean, can I ask you about the presidential nominees really quickly?, MR. SPICER:  Kevin., Q    Why is it important for the President to get these 10 individuals out there to serve the country?  And on a more broad perspective of this question, there are a number of vacancies — 129 — going into today, to say nothing of some of the openings over there in the EEOB that I’m sure could still be filled.  The pace seems slow.  Is the President aware of that pace?  Is he comfortable with the pace?  And what’s the White House doing, not just to fill those important judicial jobs, but others that are related to the administration?, MR. SPICER:  So on the judicial jobs, obviously we’re going through it in a very methodical way.  As I mentioned earlier, there’s a lot of background that goes on in each of these in terms of the Office of Government Ethics, the FBI background check that goes on.  And so they’re all in pipeline.  I think you’ll continue to see a very robust amount of announcements on not just the judicial front but on several of the fronts., And we’re really — we’ve been tracking where we are.  I think we’re well on pace with where previous administrations have been — some ahead, some a little behind — but we’re doing a great job of filling those key positions and making sure that we get the right person for the right job., ...]</td>\n",

TRUMP:  Thank you, Congressman Rogers.  It is an honor to be with you.  Today, we come together to address an issue that is close to all of our hearts: saving Americans from the disease of opioid addiction., Before I begin, I want to thank members of law enforcement for all they do to protect us each day.  (Applause.)  You are each heroes, and this administration will always honor your life-saving work., In my role as First Lady, much of my focus has been on addressing the terrible toll the opioid epidemic is having on our children and young mothers.  I have seen firsthand both the medical and personal results of this crisis.  I have visited hospitals and treatment centers around the country.  I have met with doctors, nurses, mothers, and children., We will continue to raise awareness of the dangers of opioids to unborn babies.  We are also committed to supporting more treatment facilities that help both mothers and babies recover, and replace the bond of addiction with the bond of love between a mother and her child., Last year, I was grateful for the opportunity to send a video message to the children who attended Operation UNITE’s incredible summer camp.  As I told them, I have launched an initiative to encourage young Americans to “Be Best.”  One of three pillars of this initiative is addressing the opioid epidemic.  I’m proud of this administration’s historic actions to combat this crisis., Together, we are making real progress to help people recover, to support families, and to heal our nation.  My husband is here today because he cares deeply about what you’re doing to help the millions of Americans affected by the opioid epidemic., This afternoon, he has an important message to share.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my pleasure to introduce the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  We love that song, but let’s get going.  Right?, I want to thank you all, and I want to thank, especially, Melania — she works so hard — and those moving words, even though it is from your wife, so she’s maybe a little bit prejudiced in that way.  But I will say that she is a hard worker and has a profound commitment to building a drug-free future for America’s children.  We’re going to do it too.  We’re going to do it.  (Applause.)  Made a lot of progress., Today, I’m honored to join the thousands of leaders — and that’s what you are: leaders — from across the country for the 2019 Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit.  Very important.  Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal: to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all.  (Applause.)  It’s happening.  It’s happening.  That’s happening., I want to recognize the founder of Operation UNITE for his unwavering community service, for his incredible commitment, and to address this critical issue: Congressman Hal Rogers.  A friend of mine for a long time.  And I want to thank you very much, Hal, wherever you may be.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, Hal.  Good job.  Very dedicated guy., We’re also grateful to Operation UNITE’s President and CEO, Nancy Hale.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Nancy., And thanks also to an outstanding public servant, a man who works day and night.  No matter when I need him, he’s there.  I’ll call him at the strangest hours.  He’s always there working.  Secretary Alex Azar.  It’s really great, Alex, what you’re doing.  (Applause.)  Thank you., And CDC Administrator, Dr. Robert Redfield, who is helping us to eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2030.  And we’re there; we’re going to be able to do that.  People are shocked.  Please, stand up, Doctor.  So important.  (Applause.)  I said that recently in a speech: We will eradicate AIDS by 2030.  We’ve made such incredible progress.  And they didn’t know what I was talking about.  They couldn’t believe it.  They came up to me after the speech, Doctor.  They said, “Do you mean that?”  That’s right — we’re going to have it eradicated by 2030.  Thank you very much, Doctor.  Very important., Also with us is the Lieutenant Governor of this great state, a friend of mine and a man who — he’s worked so hard with Brian.  The combination of Jeff Duncan and Brian has been pretty much unbeatable.  They’re doing a fabulous job.  Jeff, thank you very much.  Jeff, where are you?  Jeff?  (Applause.)  Jeff, thank you.  Stand up, Jeff.  Great job.  Really great job.  And, Mrs. Duncan, thank you very much., \\nAnd the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr.  Chris, thank you.  (Applause.)  Tough guy.  And he’s in there fighting for us.  I know that., As well as members of Congress: Rick Allen, Drew Ferguson, Barry Loudermilk, and Jody Hice.  We have them all.  We have them all.  (Applause.)  That’s a pretty unbeatable group.  We’ve been doing okay together, haven’t we?  Huh?  We’ve been doing good., To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis — and a crisis it is — you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation.  You may not even know it, but our nation loves you and they love what you’re doing.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.), You are the first responders who bring patients back to life.  You are the law enforcement officers who bring drug traffickers to justice.  You are the doctors, nurses, and counselors who give struggling citizens the hope and solace and strength to build a brighter and brighter future.  And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom., My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you, and to fight right by your side.  And that’s what we’re doing., We will not solve this epidemic overnight, but we will stop — there’s just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it.  I know some of the people in this room.  Nothing stops you.  Nothing stops you, I can tell you., We will never stop until our job is done, and then maybe we’ll have to find something new.  And I hope that’s going to be soon.  But we will succeed.  We have results that are unbelievable; numbers that I heard, two weeks ago, that I was shocked to hear.  We’re making tremendous progress., Each year, more than 70,000 precious American lives are lost to the opioid and drug crisis.  And, in my opinion, the number is much higher than that., To protect all Americans, my administration declared the opioid epidemic a nationwide public health emergency.  A big step.  Since then, we have secured a record $6 billion in new funding to combat the opioid crisis, and that’s the most ever.  And we’re going for even bigger numbers this year.  (Applause.), Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act — the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nation’s history.  It’s the largest ever., Following the recommendation of my Surgeon General and many others, last year the distribution of the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, increased by over one million units.  Pretty amazing stuff., To expand access to treatment, recovery, and other crucial activities and services, all throughout our nation we have given opioid response grants to states, totaling a record $2 billion., We are now allowing states to use Medicaid funds to pay for residential treatment facilities, and they’re being built all over the country.  In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent.  No other President did that.  No other President.  We have no choice.  We have no choice.  (Applause.), We passed the CRIB Act to expand treatment for mothers and their babies who are born physically dependent on opioids., For our nation’s veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017.  Think of that — 43,000.  (Applause.)  ,  [Forty-three thousand]., And, by the way, for the veterans, 45 years they’ve been trying to get it.  As you know, just recently, I signed Veterans Choice, where a veteran can go, and if the wait is going to be days or weeks or months — which it used to be — they go out and see a private doctor.  (Applause.)  Take immediate care.  We pay for it.  We take care of it.  And it’s been an incredible — it’s new and it’s been incredible, the difference it’s made., And just months ago, I signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law.  (Applause.)  Among other critical changes, the FIRST Step Act provides addiction treatment to Americans in prison., And I’m pleased to report that, in just four months, more than 16,000 inmates are participating in new drug treatment.  (Applause.)  And criminal justice reform — I have to say, people are getting out of prison.  And since our founding, they were having an impossible time getting a job.  But because our economy is doing so well, perhaps the best it’s ever been in our history — best unemployment numbers in history, best everything.  Because of this — (applause) — because of this, prisoners getting out are signing in; they’re getting jobs.  And I can tell you that those employers — because I speak to a lot of them — are thrilled.  They had no idea.  I’m so proud of that., So, the great economy has made it much easier.  They get out, and then they have to prove themselves.  They never got a chance to prove themselves.  Now they prove themselves, and they are doing a spectacular job.  Not all of them, but there’s nothing “all” about any of us.  But they are doing a spectacular job., So I want to thank all of you.  And I want to thank — Congressman, I want to thank you for helping me with that, because you were very instrumental.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.), The Department of Labor is expanding federal efforts to help recovering Americans find a great job in our soaring economy., As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction.  They’re getting a second and third and, in some cases, a fourth chance.  And they’re making it.  They’re making it.  And they really have something to live for.  Some of them say, “We love getting up in the morning.  We love going to work.  We love our job.”  And if they don’t like the job because of what’s happened, it’s a miracle.  All over the world, they’re talking about what’s happened with our economy.  If they don’t like their job, they have choice also, like the vets.  They have choice.  It’s choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better.  Big impact., Last year, a record 73 percent of the new jobs went to people who were out of the workforce and are now coming back to work for the first time in many years.  (Applause.)  And these newly employed citizens are joining 5.5 million more workers who have found jobs since the election, driving our national unemployment rate to its lowest level in 51 years., And, as you know, and you’ve heard me say it, African American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country.  Asian American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country.  Hispanic American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country., People that graduate without a high school diploma — it’s a big group — lowest in the history of our country.  Women — sorry — lowest in 61 years.  (Laughter.)  But we’ll soon have the record.  (Applause.)  We will soon have the record.  We’re going to have that record, too., We’re all Americans.  We are all one family.  And we know that we are strongest when no one is left behind., My administration is committed to ensuring that every citizen can live with dignity and purpose and proudly pursue the American Dream., Critical to this effort is my administration’s strong support for faith-based initiatives.  (Applause.)  America is a nation that believes in the power of prayer and the strength of fellowship, and we believe in the grace of God.  And we’re proud of it.  (Applause.), Here with us today is Dr. Monty Burks.  Nineteen years ago, Monty turned his life around when two women of prayer from his hometown church helped him to get on a path to recovery.  Now Monty works for Tennessee’s — what a great state — Department of Mental Health and is Director of their Faith-Based Recovery Initiative., Monty, please, come up and tell us a little bit about your work.  (Applause.), \\nDR. BURKS:  In awe, honor, and humbled.  The opposite of addiction is relationship.  That simple equation is what helped me find my freedom.  Criminal justice intervention led me to treatment, which led me to recover, which put me on this podium., I’ve been blessed to serve under Commissioner Williams — and Commissioner Varney past before.  They took a chance on a broken and bruised person who had been touched by the system, but they knew that I had a purpose, and my purpose was to use the pain that I’d went through to help other people not have to go through the same thing that I’d went through., You see, recovery is real.  We do recover.  We do recover.  (Applause.)  To me, the paradigm shifts with the faith community.  Our governor, Bill Lee, supports the faith-based community being the catalyst to change, to control the narrative, to explain how people and recovery can come back and be fruitful and change the paradigm themselves, in their own communities.  (Applause.), Employers trust the faith community.  We go back to work not just for a job but for a career, so we can go back and lead as peers so those who were behind us crying in the wilderness will have a second chance to stand before a podium like this and tell you that, yes, recovery is real.  We do recover.  (Applause.), Secretary Azar, I want to thank you for your work with HHS and the Office of Faith-Based with Shannon Royce and Heidi.  And they spread the word and the message about faith-based recovery and treatment across the state.  Today, this is my pulpit, and I have to say this: Someone in a program hears me right now and says, “I can, because you did.  I can, because he did.”  That’s right.  Yes, you can.  Look in the mirror.  There is your miracle., I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this space to stand beside you.  I want to thank God for you and the First Lady and your support of the recovery community.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Wow, that’s great, Monty.  And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone — this is the new way of doing it — (laughter) — and he never looked at it once.  (Laughter.)  That’s a pretty good job.  Thank you very much, Monty.  Appreciate it.  Fantastic., My administration has also embarked on an unprecedented effort to shut down online criminal networks, crack down on illegal international shipments, and stop the deadly flow of drugs into our country., In the past two years, Customs and Border Protection seizures of meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl at the southern border are up 45 percent and going up much higher.  We are seizing it all over.  You probably saw the numbers today.  We are detaining, capturing — call it anything you want — more people than ever before.  Some of those people are not people we want in our country., And I will say Border Patrol has been incredible.  There’s never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico.  Mexico is starting to detain and bring back to their country, where they came from.  But a lot of it is drugs, and drugs are being gotten by us.  We are stopping the drug flow as much as we can.  Soon, we’re going to have a wall that’s going to be a very powerful wall.  It’s under construction.  The media doesn’t like talking about it.  (Applause.)  The media doesn’t like talking about it.  It’s one of many things we’re doing., But when that wall is finished, we intend to have almost 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.  We’re probably ahead of schedule a little bit.  That’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country., And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that that you can buy.  Hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have.  And I always say this: Because as good as that equipment is — and it’s genius — the greatest equipment in the world is a dog.  (Applause.)  Dogs — a certain type of German Shepherd in particular.  Dogs do a better job than 400 million dollars’ worth of equipment.  Can you believe that?  Only the dog lover would understand that, right?  (Applause.)  No, it’s true., I said to the Border Patrol the other day — they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment.  And, you know, it’s hundreds — we’re close to 500 million dollars’ worth of equipment at the ports of entry.  I said, “How does this compare to those great dogs I saw?”  They say, “Sir, honestly, the dogs are better.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “You got to be kidding.”  It’s incredible, and they showed me, and it’s actually incredible.  But we also have a lot of dogs, and they’re great dogs, and we cherish them., Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border.  We’re doing everything to empower ourselves so that we can keep this poison out of our communities and away from our children.  You’re going to see some very, very big differences in the coming months.  We’re capturing people that you wouldn’t believe., And if you remember, when I announced that famous run, when I came down — I’m sure nobody saw this.  When I came down the escalator with Melania and her white dress — I don’t think anybody saw that — (laughter) — but I made a very strong statement about the border and I was criticized.  They said, “Oh, it’s not that bad.”  Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality.  Peanuts.  It was small-time, compared to reality., But we are confronting reality and confronting the grave security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border.  And that’s why I’ve declared a national emergency, which is exactly what it is.  (Applause.), And we’ve secured historic funding to strengthen border security, including the equipment, including the wall, including more Border Patrol agents — including many other things that you don’t even have to know about and some you don’t want to know about., Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws.  (Applause.)  We could solve the entire problem — I say “45 minutes,” but it could go a lot quicker than that; let’s bring it down to 15 minutes — if the Democrats would agree to do certain basic, commonsense things with respect to our laws., And I do think that there’s pressure being put on them, and I think that some of them really do want to do the right thing.  I’ve spoken to some recently, and you might be surprised at what’s going to happen.  But they see what’s going on at the border.  It’s very easy to see.  And they’re seeing the drugs and they’re seeing the human trafficking.  The human trafficking has — it’s like never before in our history.  And this is a world problem, and it’s happening all over the world, but for us, it’s through the southern border., Today, we’re grateful to be joined by Virginia State Police Senior Special Agent Tom Murphy, who has been chasing down drug traffickers for decades.  In recent years, he has seen a surge of cheap heroin being trafficked from Mexico, which is now being laced with ultra-lethal fentanyl., Tragically, a year and a half ago, Special Agent Murphy’s own son died from an overdose of this kind of deadly drug.  And it is deadly., Special Agent Murphy, America’s heart breaks for you and for all of the families that have suffered so needlessly.  No other family should have to experience the pain and the sorrow that you’ve endured., Would you please come up to say a few words?  Please, Special Agent.  Thank you.  (Applause.), SPECIAL AGENT MURPHY:  Thank you, Mr. President and First Lady, for this time and opportunity to speak.  Both professionally and personally, Hal has touched my life and my family’s life., I worked for the State Police of Virginia for 31 years, assigned to a narcotics division drug enforcement section for 23 of those 31 years.  I sat in your seat four years ago, at this same conference.  While I was here four years ago, my son Jason was battling drug addiction., His story is one that’s all too common today.  He grew up with ADD, depression, and was medicated at a young age.  Prior to 18 years old, he started self-medicating with marijuana.  He knew at 18 years old he had to move out of the house because Dad is Dad, and Dad is a police officer, and you can’t do that at home., Well, on his 18th birthday — on the day he turned 18 — he moved out of our home.  He would later tell me it’s the worst decision he’s ever made in his life., When he did so, about a year or two later, he had a work-related injury where he severed four fingers from his hand.  He was introduced to opioids, which was my greatest fear.  I would see him around town, and my wife — you could his physical decline.  He’d been arrested a couple of times for possession and distribution to continue his habit., Twelve days before Christmas — (applause) — December 13th, 2017, 12 days before Christmas, he passed away of a heroin and fentanyl overdose., People talk about stigma associated with opioids, heroin, drugs.  There is a stigma, and the stigma needs to stop.  (Applause.), If you want to think about stigma, think about a family that’s been though it professionally and personally.  And my family has.  And that’s only one family of 70,000 in 2017 who lost a loved one because of opioids and heroin., The stigma needs to stop.  You need to share your story.  I wear two bracelets every day since my son’s death.  On my right wrist is a purple bracelet to honor those who have fallen from drug overdose.  It has his name on it and date and birth and date of death.  On my left wrist, I have two: Thin Blue Line and I’ve got another one that simply states, “Every overdose is someone’s child.  Don’t judge.  Educate.”  (Applause.), So that’s why we’re here and that’s why you’re here.  You took the first initiative, maybe, if you’re here for the first time, to collaborate, to brainstorm, to strategize, to figure out this problem collectively.  But the message I want to convey today is: Don’t judge.  There are 70,000 different stories that happened in 2017.  You heard my son’s.  His name was Matthew Jason Murphy.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  You know, I think I can say with surety that your son, your boy, is looking down right now at you and he’s very proud of his father.  Very, very proud.  Thank you.  (Applause.), We are making great progress to stop fentanyl from coming into our communities.  As a result of my negotiations with President Xi of China — doing a very big trade deal — they’ve announced that next week they will implement new measures to prevent Chinese fentanyl — which is most of it; almost all fentanyl comes from China — from being shipped to the United States.  (Applause.), And furthermore — and I appreciate this, from President Xi — they’ve agreed that they’re going to make it a major crime.  It’s not a crime now.  It’s down as an industrial drug.  And they’re going to make it a crime, and they’re going to charge people with the highest level of crime.  And, in China, unlike in our country, the highest level of crime is very, very high.  It’s the ultimate.  You pay the ultimate price.  So I appreciate that very much., Since I signed the STOP Act into law, our amazing Customs and Border Protection officers have stopped over six times more packages from reaching American doorsteps.  It’s a big deal., Right here, in Georgia, Customs and Border Protection officers at the seaport in Savannah recently discovered an estimated 19 million dollars’ worth of cocaine in a shipment of Colombian pineapples., Today, we’re proud to be joined by two officers who helped find those deadly drugs: James Long and Derrick Nobles.  And thank you both for your courageous work.  Where are you, folks?  Where are you?  Come on.  Come on up here.  Come up.  (Applause.)  Please., OFFICER LONG:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you all for having us here, first of all.  And again, thank you for all your support.  It’s been a — it’s been a long road, and we’re glad to have the President behind us.  I’m glad to have you all behind us on the law enforcement side and the community itself, because you all are our biggest help with finding this.  It’s like finding a needle in the haystack, on most days., But again, thank you all every day for your support.  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you both very much.  Great job.  So many incredible people that I’ve met doing exactly what you’re doing., To all of the Customs and Border Protection officers, DEA agents, and state and local law enforcement that are here today: We love you, we support you, and we are with you all the way.  All the way.  (Applause.), You know, we had billions of dollars of military equipment, which the previous administration, for their own reason, was not willing to give up to law enforcement.  And I decided that we will.  This was beautiful, great, strong, powerful equipment, safety equipment.  You know exactly what I’m talking about.  And we gave billions and billions of dollars throughout the United States to law enforcement., And it’s had a tremendous impact because — I don’t know if it’s for that reason.  Probably not.  It’s probably because of the great men and women involved.  But the numbers are way down.  Crime — way down.  So, thank you all very much.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.), My administration is also taking aggressive action to reduce the over-supply of highly addictive prescription drugs., The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioids.  And earlier this week, the United States filed criminal charges against the sixth- largest drug wholesaler for illicit distribution of opioids — (applause) — because we are holding big pharma accountable.  They should be accountable.  (Applause.)  And they didn’t give to my campaign.  I don’t want their money.  (Laughter.)  They gave to a lot of other campaigns; that’s the problem.  But we are holding them — I couldn’t care less.  They’ve got to do what’s right.  Doing a lot of things., We’re also working very strong on drug pricing.  It’s coming way down.  For the first time — (applause) — for the first time in 54 years, drug prices went down this year.  They went down a little below even.  That’s a big thing.  First time in 54 years.  And I give great credit to you, Alex, for that.  You and your whole group of wonderful people.  Alex was a very, very successful executive at one of the biggest of the companies, and he understood the system better than anybody.  And we’re lucky to have him.  He has done an incredible job.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.), Many drug companies are giving European countries a better deal than they give their own country.  And that has to stop.  We’ve already informed them that’s stopping.  We are making sure that our great seniors on Medicare will share in the discounts given to other countries.  (Applause.)  And you know what that means.  The sophisticates out there that do this for a living, you know exactly — that’s a big deal.  Sounds like big deal, but it really is a big deal., At long last, we’re stopping the drug companies and foreign countries from rigging the system — I know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me.  (Laughter and applause.)  I think you know what I’m talking about.  Unfortunately, that will be your sound bite tonight, but that’s okay.  (Laughter.)  System was rigged.  But rigging the system against our great seniors., And to help doctors and scientists develop non-addictive painkillers, we have nearly doubled funding for opioid and pain research.  Thank you very much, Doctor.  Come on.  Stand.  (Applause.)  He gives away more money than any human being on Earth.  Thank you.  Great.  Such an important — if we can find that answer, that’s going to be a big — that’s going to solve most of the problem, I suspect.  How close are we?  (Laughter.), ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[State Dining Room, \\n10:53 A.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  And I want to thank our Vice President for that really lovely introduction.  That was very nice, Mike, and I appreciate it., This is a time of great opportunity for our country.  We’ve created nearly 3 million jobs since the election — a number that nobody would have thought possible.  You go back and take a look at what they were saying just prior to the election.  Nobody thought it was even possible., And we’ve done many other things, as you know.  And I won’t go over them because I want to be hearing from you today, but many other things that, frankly, nobody thought possible.  GDP — 3.2, 3, 3.  I think we’re going to have another really big one coming up this current quarter, maybe a number that nobody would have thought would ever be hit.  But I think we’re going to have a very good number because of the stimulus, because of the massive tax cuts that we’re all benefitting — whether you’re a Republican or Democrat, you’re benefitting tremendously from those tax cuts., Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States.  And you look at what’s going on, it’s really quite something.  You just read, a week ago, Exxon is now coming in with $50 billion — and many, many companies., Also, something that nobody expected — they’re also coming in with massive bonuses for their workers.  Nobody thought in terms of that.  We know that everybody is going to get a lot more income, and we’ve seen that as of February 1st.  Everyone is saying, “Wow, I have an extra $250 in my paycheck.”  And that’s pretty good stuff.  So we knew that was going to happen., We didn’t know that hundreds and hundreds of companies, millions and millions of people were going to be getting large bonuses because of what we did., And one of the things we’re working on is fair and reciprocal trade deals.  We’re not being treated fairly.  You, as governors, are not being treated fairly.  And when I get too tough with a country, you’re always calling, “Oh, gee, don’t do that.”  But I must say, it’s more senators and congressmen and women that call.  You haven’t been calling so much.  You want to see great deals., But we have to make the deals fair.  You know, with Mexico, as an example, we probably lose $130 billion a year.  Now, for years, I’ve been saying — for the last year and a half, I’ve been saying $71 billion, but it’s really not.  And they have a VAT tax of 16 percent, and we don’t have a tax.  And, at some point, we have to get stronger and smarter, because we cannot continue to lose that kind of money with one country., We lose a lot with Canada.  People don’t know it.  Canada is very smooth.  They have you believe that it’s wonderful.  And it is — for them.  Not wonderful for us; it’s wonderful for them.  So we have to start showing that we know what we’re doing., World Trade Organization — a catastrophe.  China became strong — you look at it.  It was going like this for years and years and hundreds of years, it was going just like this.  I’m a great — I have great respect for President Xi, by the way.  So I’m not blaming them.  I’m not blaming Mexico.  I’m not blaming anybody.  I’m blaming us because we did such a poor job for so many years., I’m not just talking about President Obama.  I’m talking about many, many, many Presidents — for 30 years, 35 years.  But the World Trade Organization makes it almost impossible for us to do good business.  We lose the cases, we don’t have the judges.  We have a minority of judges.  It’s almost as bad as the 9th Circuit.  Nothing is as bad as the 9th Circuit.  (Laughter.)  It’s almost as bad., Speaking of that, DACA is going to be put back into the 9th Circuit.  You know, we tried to get it moved quickly, because we’d like to help DACA.  I think everybody in this room wants to help with DACA.  But the Supreme Court just ruled that it has to go through the normal channel.  So it’s going back in, and there won’t be any surprise., I mean, it’s really sad when every single case filed against us is in the 9th Circuit.  We lose, we lose, we lose, and then we do fine in the Supreme Court.  But what does that tell you about our court system?  It’s a very, very sad thing.  So DACA is going back, and we’ll see what happens from there., So we want fair trade deals.  We want reciprocal trade deals.  Scott Walker has a wonderful company called Harley Davidson in Wisconsin.  Right?  Great.  So when they send a motorcycle to India, as an example, they have to pay 100 percent tax — 100 percent., Now, the Prime Minister, who I think is a fantastic man, called me the other day.  He said, “We are lowering it to 50 percent.”  I said, “Okay, but so far we’re getting nothing.”  So we get nothing, he gets 50 [percent], and they think we’re doing — like they’re doing us a favor.  That’s not a favor.  And you know what I’m talking about., It’s a great company.  When I spoke with your chairman or the president of Harley, they weren’t even asking for it because they’ve been ripped off with trade so long that they were surprised that I brought it up.  I’m the one that’s pushing it more than they are, but it’s unfair.  And India sells us a lot of motorbikes., So when they have a motorbike — a big number, by the way — they have a company that does a lot of business.  So they have a motorcycle or a motorbike that comes into our country — the number is zero.  We get zero.  They get 100 percent, brought down to 75; brought down, now, to 50.  Okay., And I wasn’t sure — he said it so beautifully.  He’s a beautiful man.  And he said, “I just want to inform you that we have reduced it to 75, but we have further reduced it to 50.”  And I said, “Huh.”  What do I say?  Am I supposed to be thrilled?  And that’s not good for you people, especially as governors.  It’s just not right.  And we have many deals like that., Now, with all of that being said, let’s talk China.  Because China, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade — $504 billion.  I think that President Xi is unique.  He’s helping us with North Korea — who, by the way, wants to talk, as of last night; you heard that.  They want to talk.  And we want to talk also, only under the right conditions.  Otherwise, we’re not talking., You know, they’ve been talking for 25 years.  Other Presidents should have solved this problem long before I got here.  And they’ve been talking for 25 years.  And you know what happened?  Nothing.  The Clinton administration spent billions and billions of dollars.  They gave them billions.  They built things for them.  They went out of their way, and the day after the agreement was signed, they continued with nuclear research.  It was horrible., The Bush administration did nothing — both.  The Obama administration wanted to do something.  He told me it’s the single biggest problem that this country has.  But they didn’t do anything.  And it would have been much easier, in those days, than it is now.  I think most people understand that.  But we’ve been very tough with them., China has been good, but they haven’t been great.  China has really done more, probably, than they’ve ever done because of my relationship.  We have a very good relationship, but President Xi is for China, and I’m for the United States.  And Russia is behaving badly because Russia is sending in what China is taking out., So China is doing pretty good numbers, but Russia is now sending a lot of stuff in.  But I think they want to see it come to an end also.  I think everybody does — talking about tremendous potential loss of lives; numbers that nobody has ever even contemplated, never thought of., So they want to talk.  First time — they want to talk.  And we’ll see what happens.  That’s my attitude: We’ll see what happens.  But something has to be done., Today, I want to hear your ideas on a number of critical issues.  But, most importantly, we want to discuss the public safety in schools and public safety, generally.  But school safety.  We can’t have this go on., I’m grateful that Governor Rick Scott is here, and we thank him for his leadership in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy in Parkland, Florida.  Horrible.  Our nation is heartbroken.  We continue to mourn the loss of so many precious, innocent young lives.  These are incredible people.  I visited a lot of them., But we will turn our grief into action.  We have to have action.  We don’t have any action.  It happens, a week goes by, “let’s keep talking.”  Another week goes by, we keep talking.  Two months go by — all of the sudden, everybody is off to the next subject.  Then, when it happens again, everybody is angry and “let’s start talking again.”  We got to stop., By the way, bump stocks — we’re writing that out.  I’m writing that out myself.  I don’t care if Congress does it or not.  I’m writing it out myself, okay?  (Applause.)  You put it into the machine gun category — which is what it is — it becomes, essentially, a machine gun, and nobody is going to be able to — it’s going to very hard to get them.  So we’re writing out bump stocks., But we have to take steps to harden our schools so that they are less vulnerable to attack.  This includes allowing well-trained and certified school personnel to carry concealed firearms.  At some point, you need volume.  I don’t know that a school is going to be able to hire a hundred security guards that are armed.  Plus, you know, I got to watch some deputy sheriffs performing this week.  And they weren’t exactly Medal of Honor winners.  All right?, The way they performed was, frankly, disgusting.  They were listening to what was going on.  The one in particular, he was then — he was early.  And then you had three others that probably a similar deal a little bit later, but a similar kind of a thing., You know, I really believe — you don’t know until you test it — but I really believe I’d run in there, even if I didn’t had a weapon.  And I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too, because I know most of you.  But the way they performed was really a disgrace., Second, we must confront the issue of mental health.  And here is the best example of mental health.  This kid — they had 39 red flags.  They should have known.  They did know.  They didn’t do anything about it.  That was really a bad time, I have to tell you.  Nobody bigger for law enforcement than I am.  But between the people that didn’t go into that school and protect those lives, and the fact that this should have been solved long before it happened — pretty sad., So we have to confront the issue, and we have to discuss mental health, and we have to do something about it.  You know, in the old days, we had mental institutions.  We had a lot of them, and you could nab somebody like this.  Because, you know, they did — they knew he was — something was off.  You had to know that.  People were calling all over the place., But you used to be able to bring him into a mental institution, and hopefully he gets help or whatever — but he’s off the streets.  You can’t arrest him, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything, but you know he’s like a boiler ready to explode, right?  So he just — you have to do something.  But you can’t put him in jail, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything., But, in the old days, you would put him into a mental institution.  And we had them in New York, and our government started closing them because of cost.  And we’re going to have to start talking about mental institutions, because a lot of the folks in this room closed their mental institutions also., So we have no halfway.  We have nothing between a prison and leaving him at his house, which we can’t do anymore.  So I think you folks have to start thinking about that., Third, we have to improve our early warning response system so that when friends, family, and neighbors do warn the authorities about a violent or dangerous individual, action is taken quickly and decisively.  Look, you had the one mother — you remember, in Connecticut, how horrible that was.  She was begging — begging — to take her son in and help him — do something, anything, he’s so dangerous.  And nobody really listened to her.  And he ended up killing her, and then the rest.  You know what happened.  It was a horror.  But she was begging to do something about her own son., Recently, you had a grandmother that got to see the notes of her grandchild, and she reported him.  And they nabbed him.  He was ready to go in for a school — looked like.  She reported him.  And there, the law enforcement did a very good job., Fourth, we must pursue commonsense measures that protect the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans while keeping guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others., And fifth, we must strive to create a culture in our country that cherishes life and condemns violence and embraces dignity., Now, with all of that, over the weekend — I cannot believe the press didn’t find this out, I can’t believe it.  I think they’re getting a little bit — I could never use the word “lazy”; you don’t want to say that.  We don’t want to give them any more enthusiasm than they already have.  But I can’t believe they didn’t figure this one — because I had lunch with Wayne LaPierre, Chris Cox, and David Lehman of the NRA.  And I want to tell you, they want to do something.  And I said, “Fellas, we got to do something.  It’s too long now.  We got to do something.”, And we’re going to do very strong background checks — very strong.  We got to do background checks.  If we see a sicko, I don’t want him having a gun.  And, you know, I know there was a time when anybody could have — I mean, even if they were sick, they were fighting.  And I said, “Fellas, we can’t do it anymore.”  And there’s no bigger fan of the Second Amendment than me, and there’s no bigger fan of the NRA.  And these guys are great patriots.  They’re great people.  And they want to do something.  They’re going to do something.  And they’re going to do it, I think, quickly.  I think they want to see it., But we don’t want to have sick people having the right to have a gun.  Plus, when we see somebody is sick like this guy, when the police went to see him, they didn’t do a good job.  But they have restrictions on what they can do.  We got to give them immediate access to taking those guns away so that they don’t just leave and he’s sitting there with seven different weapons.  (Applause.)  Got to give immediate access., Don’t worry, you’re not going to get any — you won’t — don’t worry about the NRA.  They’re on our side.  You guys — half of you are so afraid of the NRA.  There’s nothing to be afraid of.  And you know what?  If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once and a while.  That’s okay.  They’re doing what they think is right.  I will tell you, they are doing what they think is right., But sometimes we’re going to have to be very tough and we’re going to have to fight them.  But we need strong background checks.  For a long period of time, people resisted that.  But now people, I think, are really into it., And John Cornyn — great guy — senator, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Kevin McCarthy hopefully are going to work on some legislation.  I hope you guys — they started already.  In fact, John has legislation in.  We’re going to strengthen it, we’re going to make it more pertinent to what we’re discussing, but he’s already started the process.  We’ve already started it.  And the other thing — we need hardened sites.  We have to have hardened sites., So just in concluding, we have tremendous things happening.  The country is doing well, and then we have a setback like this that’s so heart-wrenching.  It’s so heart-wrenching.  And we have to — we have to clean it up.  We have to straighten it out., You know, it’s wonderful that we’re setting records on the economy.  We’re setting records.  Black unemployment at an all-time historical low.  Hispanic unemployment at a historical low.  Women unemployment at an 18-year low — 18 years.  And actually, I did very well with women during the election.  Nobody wants to give me credit for that, as you know.  But — and I’m very proud of that.  To me, these are incredible statistics., And very importantly, we’re doing — our companies are doing well.  The fundamentals are beyond what — literally beyond what anyone has ever seen.  This isn’t a bubble.  You know, there was bubbles in the past because these companies were valued and nobody understood where — where’s their money?  Where’s the money?  And these are really strong companies we’re building now.  We have tremendous underlying value., I want to bring the steel industry back into our country.  If that takes tariffs, let them take tariffs, okay?  Maybe it will cost a little bit more, but we’ll have jobs.  Let it take tariffs.  I want to bring aluminum back into our country.  These plants are all closing or closed., Recently, we put a tariff on washing machines because we were getting killed, believe it or not, on washing machines and solar panels.  That was two months ago.  You have to see the activity on new plants being built for washing machines and for solar panels.  We had 32 solar-panel plants.  Of the 32, 30 were closed, and 2 were on life-to-life resuscitation.  They were dead., Now they’re talking about opening up many of them — reopening plants that have been closed for a long time.  And we make better solar panels than China.  One of their knocks were that their solar panels were lousy, they weren’t good.  We make a much higher-quality solar panel., So, after two months, we’re opening up at least five plants, and other plants are expanding on the washing machines — which, by the way, it sounds like, sort of, a little hokey to say washing machines.  It’s a big business.  It’s a very big business.  But then you look and you see, like — I won’t mention — I won’t mention countries.  I would never do that., But how many Chevrolets are in the middle of Berlin?  How many Fords are in the middle of Tokyo?  Not too many.  In fact, Ford, sort of, closed up their operation in Japan because they couldn’t get cars in there.  I spoke to Prime Minister Abe, another great friend of mine — he’s a great person — but I said, listen, you’re sending us millions of cars, and if we send you one and if we make it so perfect — they actually told me a case where they made this car so good.  This was — they spent a fortune.  They had the best environmental, the best this, the best skins, the best — everything you can have in a car.  The best safety.  They brought it in, and after inspections that lasted forever, it was rejected., You see, that’s a form of tariff, too.  Maybe that’s a more deadly form of tariff.  That, to me, is just as deadly as 50 percent, and 25 percent, and 100 percent — in many cases., So we’re going to straighten it out.  We’ve already started.  I mean, the first year is just — we laid the seeds.  You know, a lot of it is statutory, where you can’t do anything unless you go through a process.  Well, now, through our great team, we’ve gone through that process.  Many of the — in other words, you’ll do a rule, you have to wait 90 days.  That’s, sort of, what’s happening with the bump stocks.  I’m waiting for the next process, but it’s gone.  Just don’t worry about it.  It’s gone.  Essentially gone, because we’re going to make it so tough that you’re not going to be able to get them.  Nobody is going to want them anyway., You know, bump stocks — you shoot rapidly, but not accurately.  I don’t know if you have ever heard what a bump stock does.  The bullets come out fast, but you don’t know where the hell they’re going.  That’s why nobody even, really — too much — came to its defense.  But he used it in Las Vegas.  He was using bump stocks in Las Vegas, as you know.  So we’re getting rid of them., So you’re going to ask questions.  I’m going to help you folks.  We’re going to get all of the things that we want to do, whether it’s transportation, whether it’s safety, whether it’s law and order., One of the things that the past administration would not do is give this incredible equipment that we have — excess military equipment.  Wouldn’t give it to your police.  Would not give it to your law enforcement.  They didn’t like the idea — the administration — of armored vehicles.  I guess, maybe, they’d rather have — look, why wouldn’t they want that?  People were in danger, people were being killed, people were being shot, people were being hit with rocks during some bad times and some rough places., And we’ve given out hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of our excess military equipment to your police forces.  And I will tell you, every time I go to one of your cities, they come up to me — the police — and they say, “Thank you so much for that equipment.  We feel so much safer.”  Where they can go in an armored van up to a site and not worried about being shot or hit in the head with a rock.  And to me, it’s common sense.  But, you know, what can I tell you?  But I will say this: Your group really appreciates it., So with that, I’m going to ask Brian to say a couple of words and then we’ll go around, we’ll take some questions.  Maybe we’ll have Rick Scott come up second.  And I’m here as long as you need me.  Let’s get it all out.  We want to help the governors, we want to help our states, and we want to make our schools safe., Brian?  Please.  (Applause.), GOVERNOR SANDOVAL:  Mr. President, thank you.  And I truly appreciate you.  I appreciate all the members of the Cabinet.  On behalf of all the governors, I want to thank you for your hospitality and the First Lady’s hospitality yesterday evening.  It was an extraordinary night and truly a privilege to be able to visit and enjoy fellowship., Mr. President, I appreciate, again, your having us all today.  We can talk about issues with regard to infrastructure, workforce development, combatting opioids, prison reform, agriculture, healthcare, workforce — all these different issues. And those are things that we all need to talk about., But the issue of the day is school safety, is public safety, Mr. President.  You know, I shared this last night, Mr. President: After the massacre in Las Vegas — the mass shooting, where we lost 58 people, over 500 people were injured — this was a person who used those bump stocks.  And I personally want to thank you for taking action to eliminate those, because it, essentially, was a killing field down there, where we had 20,000 people who were simply helpless.  And that is an important first step., You mentioned, in your remarks, school safety and public safety.  And we need to have this national conversation with regard to what we’re going to do.  I suppose you were looking for some suggestions, some ideas, and it will come in the form of questions, as well., But I would suggest, Mr. President, with regard to the scope of the FBI background checks, if we could broaden those, Mr. President.  Because I know, in my state, our background states are much broader.  When we do an FBI background check, it does not include an adjudication of mental illness.  It does not include an adjudication of a domestic violence protection order or a conviction for domestic violence.  I think those are things that absolutely need to be included, and there are other categories that would be included in an expansion of FBI background checks., We talked about this at dinner, with regard to Governor Scott.  And again, my heart goes out to you and to the victims there in Florida, and Texas, and everywhere else where this has happened.  And we need to have this national conversation.  We need to bring the strength, the wisdom of all the governors and everyone else across the country to have this conversation., Something else that we have done in Nevada, with regard to school safety, is, I included in my budget more money for social workers in the schools.  We’ve had shootings where we’ve had bullied students that didn’t have access to resources at the schools, so now we have a social worker in every school.  So somebody come to that — Mr. President, we talked about that last night, and that’s something else that we can do., But again, having a room together like this, there’s no problem that we cannot solve.  Every one of us brings a unique experience that we can come to solve this problem.  You’re right, Mr. President — as a parent of a daughter who attends a middle school where there was simply a rumor that something could happen, and, one day later, half the school was absent — we can’t have parents living in fear.  We can’t have students living in fear.  They can’t teach, the kids can’t learn, and it’s just no way for our education system to operate., So I know that I’m going to offer my experience to you, Mr. President.  And I think I can speak for all the governors of the United States of America that we are here to solve this problem, once and for all.  You are right, we need to take action now.  The status quo is unacceptable., So, with that, God bless you, Mr. President.  God bless our great country.  Thank you.  (Applause.), GOVERNOR SCOTT:  Well, the first thing I want to do is I want to thank the President for making something happen.  All of us, as governors, know, in any jobs we’ve had, you have to get something done.  If you — anybody that has gone through one of these — and if you’ve gone to the funeral of a 14-year-old girl that her parents just loved her, you know that you have to make a change., So what we’ve done in the last — I guess, it’s a little less than two weeks — we’ve looked at what other governors have done.  We’ve brought people together.  I’m very appreciative of what the President has done by bringing us all together to talk about this, and also what he did last week by bringing people together because it has created momentum to make sure something happens this time, that we don’t go through this and nothing happen., So, in our state, the way I’ve done this is I’ve broken it down into three things.  Number one, we’re going to have school safety.  No parent in our state is going to say, “I’m concerned whether my child can go to school safely.”  If you go to school in Florida, you’re going to know that your child can come home safely.  If you’re a teacher, if you work at one of these schools, you’re going to know you’re going to come home safely.  That’s step one., We’re going to spend $500 million.  I have two weeks left in my legislative session; I’m not waiting for the federal government.  We’re going to invest $500 million, and we’re going to have significant law enforcement presence at every public school in our state., We’ve already been investing dollars in hardening our schools.  We’re not only going to invest a lot more state dollars, but we’re going to say any local dollars that go to capital outlay by our school districts, the first thing all those dollars have to be spent on is school hardening.  It’s the most important thing we can do, is harden these schools.  So we’re going to do it., And, by the way, the way it’s going to happen is our sheriffs are going to oversee how all the money is spent to make sure that the money is spent the right way.  There will be a plan annually, and the money will be spent the right way., Number two, mental illness.  We’re going to have mental health counselors in every school to make sure that all of our students can go through counseling or meet with a mental health counselor as often as they want.  We’re going to do it., We’re also going to have threat assessment teams.  Virginia did that after their shooting.  We’re going to have that in all of our schools, where you’ll have children, families, juvenile justice, teachers, principals, local law enforcement, all together, and say, “What are the threat assessments in our schools?”  And we’re going to do that., Next, we’re going to invest more dollars in mental health in our Children and Families Program.  We do that around our state, but we’re going to invest more dollars to make sure we have youth teams all around our state to help them., Finally, we’re not going to have — you’re not going to, in Florida, have access to a gun — if you struggle with mental illness, are you going to make violent threats — you’re not going to have access to a gun in our state.  You shouldn’t have access to a gun, and you’re not., So what we’re going to do is we’re going to have a violence threat restraining order that a family member, a mental health individual, or law enforcement can go to the court system — there will be due process — but they can make sure that you don’t have access to a gun., If you’ve been involuntarily committed because you’re a threat to yourself or others, you will not have access to a gun.  You’ll have to give those guns up.  There will be due process.  You can get those guns back, but we’re going to make sure that doesn’t happen., We’re going to make sure, as you do background checks, all this information is out there so we can make sure we know who has the guns., So, in our state, we are going to get all this done, and we’re going to get it done in the next two weeks.  I’ve been talking to my legislative leadership every day.  They’re committed to be a partner.  But in Florida, I want to make sure every parent knows that their child is going to come home safe and sound every day., Thank you, Mr. President.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Rick, and thank you, Brian, very much.  Great job you’ve done, too, as chairman.  Thank you., Okay.  Would you like to say — I think I can bring this over.  It might be easier just to pass this around., GOVERNOR IVEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Like you, I believe that the local officials have an awful lot of insight into what each school needs to provide public school safety.  So as I mentioned a little earlier to this group, Mr. President, I suggested that we give our local folks a list of things that they can do quickly, like limit the number of entrances that a school has to enter the building.  And then, equip every child above the 6th grade with a chip-activated card to enter that entrance., And also, you can consider putting in a metal detector at one or two or three entrances, since you’re limiting the number of entrances.  Also, a surveillance system.  And that surveillance system can be tied to the virtual Alabama Visual Center at the Education Department, so it’s instant information all at the same time., Certainly, training in mental health situation is fine, but for the immediate, I just think we need to give some guidance to our local people, and limit the access to entrancing, and equip with surveillance systems, metal detectors, or whatever they choose to do.  Where is the money coming from?  They’ve got some local money, but, in our state budget, there’s been a technology fund.  And a senator and I are working, and he introduced the bill last week, to be able to free up some of that money for use for school safety., So these are not costly things, but they are things that can be done immediately to improve school safety., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you.  Thank you very  much, Kay., How about going around the room.  Anybody has some great ideas or suggestions?  Governor?, GOVERNOR INSLEE:  Thanks, Mr. President.  Two comments.  One from the state of Washington.  Thank you., We have a program called the Extreme Risk Protection Orders System that has been supremely effective in allowing family members that realize there’s a risk, to have them separated from their firearm.  It involves a judicial decision.  It involves a  hearing.  And it has saved lives, and I’m sure, in the state of Washington., And I would commend it to you for national attention, because it makes sure that when you have an uncle that might be — you have concern about depression — it allows law enforcement to separate your uncle, and depressed uncle, from his firearm.  If you have somebody in your family that might have some violent tendencies, after a hearing and a potential ex parte order, you get an order to actually allow law enforcement to remove them.  It’s been in operation for a year.  It’s been extremely successful.  I would commend it to you., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Rose Garden, 1:47 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I just want to say that we just spent quite a bit of time inside with the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been a friend of mine for a long time, long before my world of politics, early into his world of politics, I think. But we’ve been friends for a long time. We are probably now, despite what we read, we’re probably now — I think, at least as far as I’m concerned — closer than ever before. And the relationship is very good., We’re fighting for the same thing. We’re fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation. We’re fighting for tax reform, as part of that. We are getting close to healthcare. We’ll come up in the early- to mid-part of next year. We’re going to have a vote; I think we already have the votes. We feel confident we have the votes. We pretty much know what the plan is., I believe Republicans and Democrats are, as we speak, working together very hard, right now — working together to do an intermediate plan, a short-term plan, because Obamacare is a disaster. The rates have gone up. The premiums have gone up. The deductibles have gone through the roof. I mean, it’s terrible. If you look at the deductibles, unless you really have a problem, you’re not going to be able to use them., So we have been working together long and hard. We think we’re in good shape for the budget, we hope. And we hope to be in good shape with, again, the largest tax cuts ever passed in this country. It’s going to spur business. You look at other countries, what they’ve done — and we’re competing with other countries. When China is at 15 percent, when I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their cooperate rates down to 8 percent from 12. But you have other countries also reducing. We can’t be at 35 percent and think we’re going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs. So we worked on that., I was very honored to see a man that I’ve had a lot of respect for, James Lee Witt, of the Clinton administration — the head of FEMA. He gave us an A-plus; I just see — it just came out. And I’ve always had respect for him. He gave us — he’s the FEMA director of the Clinton administration — gave us an A-plus for how we responded to the hurricane aftermath — all of the hurricanes. And that includes Puerto Rico., So I just want to thank Mr. Witt, wherever you may be now, wherever you may be listening. I just want to say, I really much appreciate it. Because that took it out of politics — out of the world of politics, in that he was with the Clinton administration and I’m sure remains loyal to the Clinton administration. I hope he does., So just to finish off, my relationship with this gentleman is outstanding, has been outstanding. We are working very hard to get the tax cuts. We will continue to work hard to get the healthcare completed. I’m going to be surprising some people with an economic development bill later on, but I haven’t even told Mitch because I want to focus on tax cuts and some other things right now., One of the unspoken elements that we discussed at lunch — and it just is not talked about — yes, we got a great justice, Justice Gorsuch, into the United States Supreme Court. He is going to be outstanding, hopefully for many, many years. But something that people aren’t talking about is how many judges we’ve had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges. We have — tremendous — right now under review; the Democrats are holding them up beyond anything — beyond comprehension, they’re holding them up., I mean, frankly, they have terrible, terrible policy — terrible policy — and perhaps they’re not even good politicians, but they are good at obstruction. So I looked at some of these numbers, between the judges — and I want to say that we will set records in terms of the number of judges., And if you read the Wall Street Journal, I have to give them a little bit of a — a person, a writer, I won’t mention names — but you can see who has really been a really fair person — wrote an article or wrote an editorial, in a sense, saying how well we’re doing with judges and appointments. I think it’s one of the big unsung things of this administration, in addition to the fact that we have had a lot of legislation passed on the VA and lots of other things., But the judge story is an untold story. Nobody wants to talk about it. But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out. So numerous have been approved. Many, many are in the pipeline. The level of quality is extraordinary., And I just wanted to say that we’re working very closely on that also, and getting really great reviews from those people and, in many cases, some scholars that have been studying it. There has never been anything like what we’ve been able to do together with judges., So with that, I’d like to have Mitch say a few words, and if you want to do a little question-and-answer, we can do that also., Thank you very much. Thank you., LEADER MCCONNELL: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to underscore what the President said. We have the same agenda. We’ve been friends and acquaintances for a long time. We talk frequently. We don’t give you a readout every time we have a conversation. But frequently we talk on the weekends about the issues that are before us., Obviously passing a budget, which enables tax reform and tax reduction comes next, then a supplemental to take adequate care of those who have been harmed by the natural disasters we’ve been afflicted with lately. And, of course, the Senate’s unique role — it seems to be a lot of people forget — we’re in the personnel business. There are 1,200 of the President’s nominations subject to confirmation in the Senate. The House is not in the personnel business. We are., The single-most significant thing this President has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But it’s not just the Supreme Court. There are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level, as the President has indicated, of young, conservative — and when we say conservative about a judge, what we’re talking about here are, the kind of the people the President is appointing to the courts believe that the role of a judge is to try to rule based upon what the law says, not what they hoped the outcome would be., Justice Scalia used to say, if the judge is not occasionally unhappy with the conclusion he reached, he’s not a very good judge. Or as Justice Gorsuch put it down in my state a couple of weeks ago, judges don’t wear red, they don’t wear blue — they wear black., And those are the kind of people the President is sending up to the Senate to be confirmed. Many of them, as he pointed out, are younger and will be on the bench for a long time, and have a great deal to do with what kind of country we’re going to have far into the future., Legislatively, obviously the top priority is tax reduction. And I think what the President and I would both like to say to you today, contrary to what some of you may have reported: We are together totally on this agenda to move America forward., THE PRESIDENT: John., Q Mr. President, in terms of the timetable for tax reform, the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, has said he wants to get it done by the end of this year. He would make the House stay through the Christmas break in order to get it done. The Senate Majority Leader has said we’ll get it done this Congress. Would you be okay if tax reform were not passed until next year as opposed to this year?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would like to see it be done this year, John. I would like very much to see it be done this year. So we won’t go a step further. If we get it done, that’s a great achievement., But don’t forget it took years for the Reagan administration to get taxes done. I’ve been here for nine months, a little more than nine months. I can say the same thing for healthcare. If you look at Obama — first of all, if you look at Clinton, they weren’t able to get it done. If you look at other administrations, they weren’t able to get it done. President Obama, after a long period of time, was able to finally push it through, but pushed through something that’s now failed — really failing badly. But again, we’re meeting — Democrat, Republican are meeting right now, and right now they’re working on something very special., But I have to tell you, I really believe that we have a very good chance, and I think Mitch feels the same way, of getting the taxes done, hopefully fairly long before the end of the year. That’s what we’d like to see., Go ahead., LEADER MCCONNELL: Let me just add to what the President said. The goal is to get it done this calendar year. But it is important to remember that Obama signed Obamacare in March of year two. Obama signed Dodd-Frank in July of year two. We’re going to get this job done, and the goal is to get it done by the end of the year., THE PRESIDENT: And just to finish up for Mitch — and we’re nine months, right? So we could have a long way to go, but that’s okay., Yes., Q Thank you very much. Do you both have confidence in Representative Tom Marino to be your drug czar? And on healthcare, in your recent (inaudible), you said, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that after hearing repeal and replace for seven years, he failed. That should never have happened.” Do you still (inaudible)?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, let’s go to the second part of your question, with Mitch. Again, we’ve been doing healthcare for, really, seven months, and probably six months, if you think about it, because we started in probably a total of six months. Others were 2.5 years, and much more than that. Others were eight years, and they didn’t get it passed. This man is going to get it done, and I think get it done long before anybody else, and I think it’s going to be a great healthcare., As far as Tom Marino, so he was a very early supporter of mine — the great state of Pennsylvania. He’s a great guy. I did see the report. We’re going to look into the report and we’re going to take it very seriously. Because we’re going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem. And I want to get that absolutely right. This country — and, frankly, the world — has a drug problem. The world has a drug problem. But we have it, and we’re going to do something about it., So I’m going to have a major announcement on that problem next week. We’re going to be looking into Tom., Q Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News Network. I’d like to ask you: Do you support the plan by people who previously served in your administration, such as the Steve Bannon, to primary Republican candidates in the 2018 elections who do not support your agenda?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have a very good relationship, as you know, with Steve Bannon. Steve has been a friend of mine for a long time. I like Steve a lot. Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing. Some of the people that he may be looking at, I’m going to see if we talk him out of that, because, frankly, they’re great people., What Mitch will tell you is that maybe, with the exception of a few — and that is a very small few — I have a fantastic relationship with the people in the Senate, and with the people in Congress. I mean, I have a — with our House of Representatives. I have a great relationship with political people. If you read the papers, you think — I’m like on one island and they’re like on the other. Well, it’s not the way it is., We have a fantastic relationship. I’m friends with most of them, I can say. And I don’t think anybody could have much of a higher percentage. But I’m friends with most of them. I like and respect most of them, and I think they like and respect me., Just so you understand, the Republican Party is very, very unified. When we get things approved, we have to go through hell because we have no Democrat support, we have nobody. We don’t have a vote from the Democrats. As an example: massive tax cuts — we may not get any Democrat votes. Now, we also may get three of four, but we may get no — for massive tax cuts. We’re the highest-taxed country in the world, and yet we may get no Democrat support. And that’s because they’re obstructionists and they just basically want us to do badly, but that’s not going to happen., Yes, go ahead., Q On the opioid crisis, I listened to you on the campaign trail talk about that repeatedly. You said you watched the “60 Minutes” report last night. Number one, do you want to reverse the law that Congressman Marino helped pass that DEA whistleblowers say has contributed to the expansion of the opioid crisis?, THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to look at that very closely., Q And does his sponsorship of that law in any way undermine your confidence in him as drug czar?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, he’s a good man. I have not spoken to him, but I will speak to him and I’ll make that determination. And if I think it’s one percent negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change, yes., Q Mr. McConnell —, Q Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT: One second. Yes., Q What about declaring a written national emergency for this crisis? You’ve talked about it but you haven’t put that piece of paper together., THE PRESIDENT: We are going to be doing that next week. By the way, you know that’s a big step. By the way, people have no understanding of what you just said. That is a very, very big statement. It’s a very important step. And to get to that step, a lot of work has to be done and it’s time-consuming work. We’re going to be doing in next week, okay?, Q Did you have a chance, during your lunch today, to discuss the comments that Steve Bannon made this weekend? And what do you make of those comments, declaring war on the Republican Party, declaring war on you?, LEADER MCCONNELL: Look, you know, the goal here is to win elections in November. Back in 2010 and 2012, we nominated several candidates — Christine O’Donnell, Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock. They’re not in the Senate. And the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election., My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority. The way you do that is not complicated. You have to have nominate people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home. We changed the business model in 2014; we nominated people who could win everywhere. We took the majority in the Senate. We had one skirmish in 2016; we kept the majority in the Senate. So our operating approach will be to support our incumbents and, in open seats, to seek to help nominate people who can actually win in November. That’s my approach and that’s the way you keep a governing majority., Q Mr. President, earlier today you criticized drug companies and also insurance companies, saying that drug companies were charging prices that are too high —, THE PRESIDENT: Yes., Q — and insurance companies were taking government money —, THE PRESIDENT: Exactly right., Q What specifically would you like to see both of those types of companies do?, THE PRESIDENT: So the insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare — an absolute fortune. As you know, what I did with the cuts at the end, which were all going — you know, you’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a month going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I’m very happy with what I did., And because of that, people are talking now. Democrats are talking to the Republicans for a short-term taking care of, what we will call, healthcare so that people can have good healthcare without a big spike. You would have had massive spikes — you already have. I mean, every year the massive spikes to Obamacare have been ridiculous., As far as — and I didn’t speak to Mitch about this today, but a priority of mine — and you know that this is coming up — will be the cost of prescription drugs. We are going to get the costs way down, way down, and those drugs companies — so you have the insurance companies, in the one case; in the other case — actually, with regard to both, you have the drug companies., They contribute massive amounts of money to political people — I don’t know, Mitch, maybe even to you. But I have to tell you, they contribute massive amounts of money. Me, I’m not interested in their money. I don’t need their money. I will tell you, you have prescription drugs — you go to England, you go to various places, Canada — you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything, is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the United States., We are going to get drug prices — prescription drug prices way down because the world has taken advantage of us. The world has taken advantage of us when that happens, so that’s going to be very important., Q Thank you. On healthcare, there are about 6 million people that get subsidies to help pay for Obamacare — about 70 percent, by one study of a couple of states that you won in November —, THE PRESIDENT: Yeah., Q Now that you’ve cut off these payments, are you going to ensure that those people will still get help from the federal government to pay —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s what we’re looking to do, Joe. We want to get it down so that people can have affordable healthcare. Look, you look at some states — 116 percent up. In Alaska, over 200 percent up. In other states, 50 percent, 70 percent up, and those are some of the states that are doing better. Obamacare is a wreck, it’s a mess, it’s destroying lives. We want to get it in those states — the states that I did so well in — but also in states that I didn’t win., I want to get healthcare that’s much more affordable and much better healthcare, and that’s what we’re doing., Yes., Q Let me ask you about tax reform., THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead — tax reform., Q Yes, tax reform. You had said the other day that there were some adjustments being made., THE PRESIDENT: Yeah., Q Gary Cohn said today that there would be some things that are negotiable. What exactly, in your eyes, is negotiable? And then, for the Leader, you said that the top priority is tax reduction — you did not say tax reform — in 2017, Leader McConnell. So can you commit specifically to tax reform in 2017? For the both of you., THE PRESIDENT: So we are doing minor adjustments. We want to make sure that the middle class is the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts and tax reform. And that’s, I’m sure, what Mitch meant also, because people get it confused., We are doing massive tax cuts. We’re also doing simplification and reform. Simplification, where, literally, if we can do it on page; now, in some cases, it may be two pages. But we’re doing major simplification. We’re bringing the categories down from — if you include zero, because there are zero — we’re bringing it from eight to four. That’s a big, big simplification, just that alone., But we are doing the massive cuts. And I will say this: Wherever I’ve been, this has been so popular with the people. Now we have to get a couple of additional people to raise their hands., Mitch., LEADER MCCONNELL: Yeah, I agree with the President, it’s about both reduction and reform. It’s been 30 years since this kind of effort was undertaken successfully, and we’re going to succeed this time. The bills, the details of them, will be written by the Ways and Means and Finance Committees after we approve the budget. And obviously, the budget opens the path to tax reform. But it’s a both — it’s about both — about both reform and reduction., Q Why haven’t we heard anything from you so far about the Soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that?, THE PRESIDENT: I’ve written them personal letters. They’ve been sent, or they’re going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend. I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families — because I have done that, traditionally. I felt very, very badly about that. I always feel badly. It’s the toughest — the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It’s a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day — it’s a very, very tough day. For me, that’s by far the toughest., So, the traditional way — if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn’t make calls, a lot of them didn’t make calls. I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice., So, generally, I would say that I like to call. I’m going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I’m going to be calling them. I have — as you know, since I’ve been President, I have., But in addition, I actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers we’re talking about, and they’re going to be going out either today or tomorrow., Yes., Q General Kelly said just last week that you believe that Cuba could stop the attacks against Americans. Do you believe them, that Cuba is — do you believe Cuba is responsible?, THE PRESIDENT: I think Cuba knew about it, sure. I do believe Cuba is responsible. I do believe that. And it’s a very unusual attack, as you know, but I do believe Cuba is responsible, yes., Q Roy Moore, down in Alabama, has said that he believes homosexuality should be illegal and that Muslims should be barred from serving in the U.S. Congress. What makes you comfortable with someone with those beliefs serving in the U.S. Senate? And the same question to you, Mr. Leader., THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to be meeting with Roy sometime next week, and we’re going to talk to him about a lot of different things. But I’ll be meeting with him., He ran a very strong race. The people of Alabama, who I like very much and they like me very much, but they like Roy. And we’ll be talking to him, and I can report to you then. Okay?, Go ahead., Q Mr. President, this is a question for you and for Leader McConnell following up on your comments on the budget. One of the issues outstanding right now is what the Senate Judiciary Committee will (inaudible) of blue slips. I’m wondering what your position is, Mr. President, and what your position is, Leader McConnell. Because, you know, (inaudible) that right now gives Democrats leverage over the appointments., LEADER MCCONNELL: I can give you my position. The blue slip, for those of you who are not familiar with it, is a custom determined by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And Senator Grassley can give you his view of how he views this. I’ll give you my view., My view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge is simply a notification of how you’re going to vote. To conclude otherwise would have left us in the following position at the beginning of this Senate. Forty-eight Democratic senators would have been able to blackball 62 percent of the circuit judge nominees. That’s simply not a tenable place to land in a Senate that now deals with judges with a simple majority., So my own personal view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge should simply be a notification of how you intend to vote., THE PRESIDENT: We could talk blue slips, but my attitude is I just want really capable people going to the courts., Peter., Q Mr. President, in 2012 you tweeted that “Obama’s complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS,” in your words, “since he had full control for two years.” You wrote, “He can never take responsibility.” But today, you’ve said about some of the challenges right now in Congress and in Washington, “I’m not going to blame myself, I’ll be honest. They’re not getting the job done.” So what’s different then than now?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just explain what’s different. We have nominations pending right now, and we have 182 approved — if you look at this: the number that he had approved was 65 percent and 70 percent, and we have 39 percent. They’re holding up every single nomination., Q How about the agenda broadly?, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:43 P.M. EST, MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thanks for coming., Last night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court.  It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia.  As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing., In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles., During his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators — including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy — were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006., With as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate., Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia., Judge Gorsuch’s academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship., Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text.  He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the — he believes — sorry, I almost screwed that one up — (laughter) — he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings.  He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background., And I would note, I think — and I always want to caveat this — but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the — as someone he clerked for on the bench.  So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate., Now, on to the issues of the day.  Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month.  The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room.  The meeting also included some of the administration’s African American appointees., Later today, the President will issue a proclamation.  The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 — excuse me, 1994 and 2004.  President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon., At events throughout this entire month, we’ll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders — from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas.  African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that., Continuing with today’s schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night.  On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell.  And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner., With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it’s a good time to talk about the confirmation process.  Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster.  They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified.  And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment., Also this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, including David O’Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center;, \\nWayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute., President Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President.  He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law., The attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign.  They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote.  The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor., The President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson.  Mr. Tillerson’s tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination., Later this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  So far, between the Vice President and staff, we’ve had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the President’s nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court., Now, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination process.  Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where I’m going with that:  Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the President’s attempts to make America great again., Just today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present.  Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt’s hearing.  They’re doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics.  The President’s Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote., In other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today.  We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General., Additionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — designee — is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon.  And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon., A few more things before I open it up for questions., \\nIn terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House.  The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady.  Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon., A few personnel announcements.  Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate:  Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General., On another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the President’s executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry.  I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject.  For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking.  A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent — which is a clear majority — of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat., A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country.  And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President’s top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he’s taking to keep our country safe., Further, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the President’s decision to take our national security so seriously.  The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the “structural problems” faced by these nations., I know that there was a question on Monday regarding Iran’s firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel.  I’d like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update., GENERAL FLYNN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran’s destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East., The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.  These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea., In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms.  The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk., President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.  Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice., Thank you., MR. SPICER:  Thanks, General.  We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff — NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room.  Further details will be provided on that subject.  So thank you, General, with that., As we start off, I mentioned yesterday I’m pleased that we’ve expanded the briefing room — at least virtually.  And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I’m pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island., Kim., Q    Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me okay?, MR. SPICER:  We can., Q    Great.  Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city.  As we know, President Trump’s executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them.  What I’m wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list, and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?, MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Kim.  I think the President’s goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear.  We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe.  The goal is to make sure on two fronts.  One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that.  Furthermore, the President has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities., As we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we’ll have further updates on how we tend to — on how that list will come out and when it will come out.  So I look forward to following up on that as well., \\nWith that, David Jackson., Q    David isn’t here but I’ll ask a question.  (Laughter.), MR. SPICER:  Go for it.  (Laughter.), Q    Maybe he’s on Skype?  (Laughter.), Q    The President’s daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing.  Can you tell me how that differs at all from the PDB?  Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally, and who is giving it to him?, MR. SPICER:  He did receive an intelligence briefing today.  Congressman — or Director Pompeo was here.  General Flynn, his national security advisor, his briefer.  So he receives an intelligence briefing and the PBD every day., Q    Is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the PDB?, MR. SPICER:  I think it is a more comprehensive — again, I think — we went through this during the transition period, right?  There is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis, and I think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials.  But every single day, he does receive the PBD.  And then I think, on top of that, he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team., Q    But the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every day?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I can get back to you on that.  He does get the PBD every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team, yes., Q    Two quick questions., MR. SPICER:  We’re not going to do this again., Q    On Black History Month., MR. SPICER:  Yeah., Q    Is President Obama being invited to any of the Black History Month celebrations?, MR. SPICER:  Not that I’m aware of.  It’s day one.  We just started it off.  We’ll have to get back to you on further details.  I think —, Q    And if I may —, MR. SPICER:  We have a lot — there’s a lot of activities, as I mentioned, that the President is going to do to celebrate and honor this month.  And this was just the first day of the month of February., Q    And today he made the comment about Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more.  Do you have any idea what specifically he was referring to?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s contribution — I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made.  And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he’s going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more., Kristen., Q    Thank you.  Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by “we’re putting Iran on notice?”, MR. SPICER:  Well, as I mentioned, I think General Flynn and the NSC staff will have a briefing at 4:00 p.m.  They can go forward.  I’m not going to — I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that — their actions were both provocative and a violation, and making sure that they understood that we weren’t going to sit by and not act on those actions., Q    Are you building the case to —, MR. SPICER:  I’m just — I’m not going to go any further than that, Kristen., Q    Okay, then let me ask you about — let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings.  How does the President plan to get Chuck Schumer onboard with his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, when he has referred to him as a “clown” and accused him of fake tears?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think those are two things.  I think we’re going to — you look at the support that’s already come out.  I think there’s eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications.  And not just the Senate but I mean you look at the widespread support that came out for Judge Gorsuch last night across the spectrum.  No matter your philosophical view of the Court, I think his qualifications for the Court, his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified person., And so it’s not just Chuck Schumer; I think the rest of the Senate as he goes up there — but I think the interesting thing —, Q    Sure —, MR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on.  I understand that.  And I think Chuck Schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the Cabinet that he’s more interested in politics than actually moving the government along.  And I think that is troubling., I would ask you that — I think that the question needs to be asked to Chuck Schumer:  Why are you stalling all of these nominees?  Why are you insisting on new requirements that you didn’t assume for Sotomayor or Kagan?  I mean, there’s a point at which they need to get asked, why are they obstructing government at every step of the way?  There’s an element to which they need to be held accountable as well.  They held certain standards in place for their nominees, both for the bench and for the Cabinet.  And the question is, are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on Republicans when they had nominees in a Democratic White House., Q    But does the President think that by personally insulting Chuck Schumer that’s a way to get —, MR. SPICER:  But again, Kristen, I think the goal is to get — when — but again, I would go back.  Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this.  There’s a lot of comments that he’s made and a lot of accusations that he’s thrown out there and a lot of politics that he’s played.  At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words., Blake., Q    Sean, the President today invoked the possibility on the Supreme Court, Sean, of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option.  If it gets to that point, is the White House comfortable with that path?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President made clear his goal today, which is, number one, he believes that Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated — not only confirmed, but done so with a large bipartisan vote.  As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the Obama administration, and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy, definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did so., I think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the Democrats used when they had nominees up.  But I think the President made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down, but also that it is ultimately up to Senator McConnell and how he wants to operate this., John Gizzi., Q    Thank you, Sean.  Just one question today.  Leading up to Judge Gorsuch’s announcement last night and him coming out after, there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to Washington., MR. SPICER:  No, actually, John, he didn’t.  That was media — that was misreporting.  My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  So with all due respect, I can’t be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here.  He never was at the White House.  My understanding is he had a meeting in eastern Pennsylvania with another judge.  But it was — and, again, I’m not — I don’t track his whereabouts, but my understanding is he never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania yesterday.  So it was — we announced when we were going to make this announcement.  I think it was a phenomenal way to introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and the United States Senate.  We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Unfortunately, none of them showed up.  But it was an opportunity for them and the American people to see an amazing choice that the President made for the bench., Anita., Q    My question, Sean, my question is —, MR. SPICER:  You said one, John., Q    But I didn’t ask the question.  My question is simply this:  With the support that he received, the people who called the President, would it be safe to say that Judge Hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon — say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end of the term?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government.  He’s an impressive, impressive jurist.  Obviously the four that really made that final list for the President were unbelievably impressive.  So I don’t want to get in front of the President., \\nHopefully he continues to have the President’s support and is someone that the President was unbelievably impressed with.  So we’ll have to see what vacancies come down the pipe., Anita., Q    I know you love when we say we have two questions.  I do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top.  First, you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the Department of Justice.  Why are they being nominated now, before Senator Sessions is there?  Is it because there’s a lack of people?  Was he consulted?  Or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney general?, MR. SPICER:  It’s the normal process of getting those — I’ve mentioned at a few briefings — the deputies, the unders, and the actings are in the pipeline.  We announced one the other day for Homeland.  We’ve got Commerce was previously announced.  And so this is just a continuation of the process to fill —, Q    So would then Senator Sessions — I mean, in speaking with him —, \\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.  These are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of, 100 percent., Q    Okay.  And then the second question was, you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley Davidson executives.  There’s reporting that he was supposed to go to Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to.  That was canceled because of the company.  Can you talk about that?, MR. SPICER:  I just think — look, it was easier for the executives to come here, considering the week and all of the activity that’s been going on.  And we figured the easiest thing to do was — again, no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing.  We looked at different options and, ultimately, the easiest thing to do in accordance with the President’s schedule was to invite them here to Washington to talk about some of the stuff that we’ve been doing., Q    Are you worried about protesting?, ...]</td>\n",

       "4    [ “I thought my friends across the aisle would jump at this opportunity to fulfill what they say is their top priority. But they just could not take ‘yes’ for an answer. They turned away from a golden opportunity to solve this issue. They decided they’d rather come away empty handed, with no resolution whatsoever for the 1.8 million individuals they say they are championing, than accept a reasonable compromise with the president.”,  “On Tuesday the Majority Leader tried twice to open the debate and start voting, but both times there were objections heard by our Democratic colleagues. This despite their repeated promises over the years to address the DACA issue once and for all.”,  “Today is a sad day for many Americans and for many dreamers who would have had a rare pathway to citizenship. We had the opportunity to pass a bill that would have provided legal certainty for 1.8 million individuals. It would have secured the border and focused enforcement on the very worst criminals, like sex offenders, human rights violators and war criminals. And importantly, it had the President’s support and could have actually become law…. It’s unfortunate that so many of my colleagues, when given the chance to finally give citizenship to DACA kids, refused to do so.”,  “President Trump presented a thoughtful framework to accomplish these shared goals and Senator Grassley’s amendment, which I supported, turned that framework into legislation that could become law. Given our mutual goals, it should have passed the Senate in a bipartisan manner. I am disappointed that it did not.”,  “What this debate has shown is just how unserious the Democrats are about illegal immigration. If they were serious, they wouldn’t have shut down the government over DACA only to reject the one bill, endorsed by the president, that would’ve given DACA recipients the legal certainty they need. And they wouldn’t have introduced such a reckless proposal that had zero chance of becoming law. There’s broad agreement about how to solve this problem, but we won’t succeed unless the Democrats stop this incessant virtue-signaling and start negotiating in good faith.”,  “Senate Democrats have shown their true colors. First, they shut down the government over DACA. Today, they had an opportunity to vote to provide certainty for 1.8 million DACA recipients and they voted no. Senate Democrats said they wanted a bipartisan solution, but really they don’t. Senate Democrats said they want to secure our border, but really they don’t. Today, Senate Democrats crushed the dreams of many people who were counting on them to deliver and showed they are quite happy to have an immigration system that does not serve the American people or protect our national security.”,  “In case you didn’t think Congress was absurd before, Senate Democrats are now filibustering the open immigration debate they asked for, and are refusing to put their bill on the floor.”,  “I voted for Senator Grassley’s measure based on President Trump’s proposal. We must stop human trafficking, money laundering and drug trafficking. This amendment provided real border security and discouraged future human trafficking. As a compromise, it also addressed Democrats’ concerns. This was the only bill that could become law. If Democrats truly wished to solve immigration issues, they should have supported this bill.”,  “It is disappointing that a minority of the Senate blocked my bipartisan proposal to end sanctuary cities and protect the safety and security of America.”,  “I voted against the proposal put forward by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer because the Department of Homeland Security said it would not secure the border, nor did it end the diversity lottery system or adequately address chain migration.”,  “Most of what was proposed by the President and Senate Republicans has passed the Senate multiple times over the past fifteen years, but not today. It’s disappointing that Democrats would not come to the table simply because President Trump supported it. Immigration reform is complicated and emotional, but it is essential that we keep working until we reach a good faith solution for the future of all Americans.”,  “I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to reach an agreement today on immigration policy…. It was also deeply troubling that a minority of Senators blocked consideration of my common-sense bipartisan amendment designed to end dangerous sanctuary city policies.”,  “I have said from the beginning that we must secure the border and keep our nation safer, reform our legal immigration system, and find a permanent, compassionate solution for DACA recipients. Today, I voted for measures that would accomplish these things, namely the Secure and Succeed Act and legislation to stop sanctuary cities, and against measures that do not. Democrats continue to try and use Dreamers as a political tool, and we continue working to find a solution.”,  “Trump has shown presidential leadership on immigration. Senate Democrats should take my fellow Tennessean – Howard Baker’s – advice that ‘the other fellow might be right,’ and the other fellow in this case might be named President Trump.”,  “I share the President’s commitment to border security. That’s why I voted for his plan. That’s why I fought to ensure the $25 billion he requested for border security was included in the bipartisan deal. That’s why I opposed the Democratic proposal that did not provide a single penny for border security.”,  “Sad to see that the US Senate could not find any path forward on DACA and immigration reform today. Of interest, Sen Stabenow voted to defund ‘Sanctuary Cities’.”,  “Senate Democrats blocked a vote on #SanctuaryCities. Only further proving that they care more about illegals than actual Americans.”, \\nFox Business’ Trish Regan: “President [Trump] is extending a massive olive branch on immigration, but the Democrats don’t want to make a deal! Maybe they don’t want Republicans to get the credit for giving these dreamers a path to citizenship!”]

       "6    [Cabinet Room, \\n3:29 P.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT:  So, thank you all very much — very much for being here.  And a lot of friends in the room.  A lot of great friends.  And, Mr. Vice President, thank you.  And, Secretary Nielsen, thank you very much.  We’re doing a great job on the border, considering we don’t have the tools.  They don’t give us the tools to work with, meaning we have to have a wall.  We have to have a barricade of some kind — a steel barricade.  It’s already designed., We’re building a lot of wall as we speak — a tremendous amount.  And we’re renovating a lot of the other wall.  Otherwise — by the way, with what’s coming up, because of the strong economy that we have — we haven’t had an economy like this, I guess, in over 50 years.  Would you say that’s correct, Steve?, And because of the strong economy, everyone is pouring up, and we’re stopping them.  But it’s a lot of work.  We have incredible people at the border, and you have to thank all of the Border Patrol agents and the ICE agents I see in Long Island.  They don’t want ICE.  The radical Democrats don’t want ICE there because they’re too good; they’re doing too good a job., And I always talk about Long Island; that’s one of the real hotbeds for the MS-13 gangs.  And I just see this morning, where the, really, radical Democrats don’t want them there because they don’t want to do anything to disturb MS-13.  And when you think about it, MS-13 is about the most violent gang, they say; one of the most violent anywhere in the world.  And they have done — we’re sending them out by the thousands out of our country.  So we think it’s too bad., But I would say this: That the State of the Union speech has been cancelled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn’t want to hear the truth.  She doesn’t want the American public to hear what’s going on.  And she’s afraid of the truth.  And the super-left Democrats, the radical Democrats — what’s going on in that Party is shocking.  I know many people that were Democrats and they’re switching over right now, and they’re switching over quickly.  So I hope they know what they’re doing for their Party.  So far, they haven’t.  If you know, I won the Senate — meaning we won the Senate altogether — but we get no credit for that.  They don’t talk about that.  They talk about the House., I didn’t have any chance to — other than a couple of people, like from Kentucky, where I went and campaigned for Andy Barr and for some others, they ended up winning their races.  But I couldn’t campaign too much.  Too many people.  But we did a great job with the Senate, and people don’t want to talk about it., I will say that the American people want to hear the truth.  They have to hear the truth.  And the truth is all about — and said, I think and I hope, well — we were planning on doing a really very important speech in front of the House and the Senate, the Supreme Court, and everybody else that’s there.  It’s called the State of the Union.  It’s in the Constitution.  We’re supposed to be doing it., And now, Nancy Pelosi — or “Nancy,” as I call her — she doesn’t want to hear the truth, and she doesn’t want to hear — more importantly, the American people hear the truth.  So we just found out that she’s cancelled it, and I think that’s a great blotch on the incredible country that we all love.  It’s a great, great, horrible mark.  I don’t believe it’s ever happened before, and it’s always good to be part of history.  But this is a very negative part of history.  This is where people are afraid to open up and say what’s going on.  So it’s a very, very negative part of history., I’d like to start today — we’re talking about shutdown; we’re talking about some conservative values.  These are the great conservative leaders of our country, and they have very strong views.  And we’ll be doing that after the press leaves.  But they have very strong views on the shutdown.  And it’s not that we have a choice.  I don’t think we have a choice.  We have to make our country safe.  We have done such an incredible job with such poor tools.  We have catch-and-release, where you catch somebody and then you have to release that person into our country., We have so many different elements of rule and regulation.  It’s a very sad thing that’s gone on.  And this has happened over a long period of time., If you take a look at the visa lottery — when there’s a lottery, do you think they’re putting their best people into those lotteries?  It’s a lottery.  You know what a lottery is.  Does anybody think they’re putting their best people in?, You have chain migration, where, as an example, the killer — the man who ran over people on the West Side Highway in New York — 8 people killed, 12 injured.  And when you say “12 injured,” nobody knows how badly injured they are.  This isn’t like they had a headache.  This is big, big, and horrible problems.  Loss of legs and arms, and worse.  And this man brought in many people — many, many people — through chain migration, it’s called., So these are all Democrat principles that are no good for our country; they’re hurting our country.  And if we did what we had to do, you would bring crime down in half in our country, because so much of it comes through our southern border., Honduras is doing nothing for us.  Guatemala is doing nothing for us.  El Salvador is doing nothing for us.  And we pay them hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but we’re going to be stopping pretty soon.  In fact, we’re looking at it right now.  We don’t want to do it.  Because when caravans form in the middle of a country, the country can very easily stop those caravans from forming, very easily.  I actually think they encourage the caravans because they want to get rid of the people from their country, and certain people.  A lot of gang members are there.  In the last caravan, we had 618 people with criminal records, and some of them very serious records., I won’t soon forget the man that was interviewed where he wanted some kind of pardon, or whatever, when he came into the country.  And the network person said, “Well, what did you do?”  And he said “murder” or something to that effect.  And she goes, “Whoa, murder.”  Well, we have — that’s what we have.  We have a lot of very dangerous people that want to come into our country.  And we’re not letting them in., We want people to come in based on merit.  We want people to come in that can help us successfully run all these companies that are pouring into the United States because of what we’ve done and because of all of the incentives, Steve, that we’ve given, and because this is where the action is.  Steve Moore is one of the great financial gurus, and he would tell you how well we’re doing as a country., But we have a lot of people that, really, we need.  We have the lowest unemployment rate we’ve had in much more than 50 years, with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American.  We have the lowest unemployment rate we’ve had in the history of our country., And that’s why, when you look at the Hispanic polls, I’m up 19 percent.  And the reason I’m up 19 percent — I don’t even think it’s the unemployment; I think it’s the fact that they understand, better than anybody, what’s going on at the border., And they say that President Trump is the only one that’s saying it right, and he’s doing what you have to.  That’s why people were so surprised when they saw the poll that just came out, where I’m up to 50 percent with the Hispanic and up 19 points in a short period of time.  Because they get it better than anybody at the border.  They know what’s happening at the border and they know it’s a big scam., And the Democrats don’t want to stop people.  That means automatically massive amounts of crime.  And we’re not going to put up with it., So Nancy Pelosi, knowing these facts, and knowing it’s something that she can’t win, that she just went out and said, let’s cancel — for the first time in the history of our country — “Let’s cancel the State of the Union Address.”  And it’s a disgrace.  Just so you know, she uses on the basis of the shutdown.  But when she asked me to make the address — formally, in writing; most of you have a copy of the letter — when she asked me to make the address, she did it during the shutdown — well into the shutdown, by a couple of weeks., So the shutdown was going on.  Now she’s blaming the shutdown.  So if it was because of the shutdown, why do you ask that the address be made?  And she asked that the address be made during a shutdown, and now she’s blaming the shutdown., She also knew — because she went to our people and she asked, “Would it be a security problem?”  She knew it wasn’t a security problem.  She blamed security, but she knew it wasn’t a security problem, and she knew that loud and clear., And she went to the people.  She asked.  They said, “We have no problem whatsoever.”  I just got back from Iraq.  I was very safe in Iraq, and I felt very safe.  We had great, great security.  If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington in a very, very spectacular building, and a beautiful room that we should be in, and that’s where it’s been for a very long time., So it’s a sad thing for our country.  We’ll do something in the alternative.  We’ll be talking to you about that at a later date., But I have to say, it’s an honor to have these great leaders with us, and we’re going to be talking about shutdown.  We’re going to be talking about other things.  And we’re going to be talking about — outside of this event that we just discussed — how well our country is doing, because we’re setting records in so many different ways.  We’re setting jobs records., Right now, at this very moment, we have more people working in the United States than at any time in the history of our country.  Think of that.  That’s a big, big statement.  I just had a meeting on drug pricing and various other things.  And prescription drugs, for the first time in history — the history of our country — have gone down in 2018., So for last year — just got the numbers — for the first time in the history of our country, prescription drug prices have gone down.  They’ve been like a rocket ship until I got here.  And we have more to do.  They’re going to go down further.  But think of that: For the first time — I say it because you guys don’t want to report it, but that’s a big thing, because drug pricing has been very important to me, as is healthcare., First time in the history of our country, in 2018, prescription drug prices have gone down.  That’s a big number.  And you didn’t even know that.  I don’t think anybody at this table knew that.  It just came out.  So we’ll let you know., So it’s too bad with Nancy Pelosi, what she’s done.  It’s radical Democrats.  They’ve become a radicalized party.  They really have.  They have become a radicalized party.  I actually think they’ve become a very dangerous party for this country.  If you listen to what they’re saying, what they’re doing, I think they’ve become a very dangerous — a very, very dangerous party for this country., I think that Chuck Schumer, sadly, is dominated by the radical left, and he is dominated by Nancy Pelosi.  Very strongly dominated.  He can’t move; he’s a puppet.  He’s a puppet for Nancy Pelosi, if you can believe that.  But that’s what’s become and that’s what’s happening., And we’re not going to let it happen to our nation, and we are not going to allow the radical left to control our borders.  Because if they do, you will see crime; you will see drugs; you will see human trafficking like you have never seen ever in the history of our country.  You will never see anything like what you would see.  So we will never let the radical left control our borders., Thank you very much.  Thank you., Q    Mr. President, are you not giving the speech on Tuesday night?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll be announcing what we’re doing., Q    Sir, she said it’s not cancelled but that she wants to come to an agreeable date.  So, will you agree to a new date?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see.  We’ll see.  Well, it wouldn’t be very hard, but that’s not what she means.  And it’s very sad.  I think it’s a very, very bad thing for our country, and it’s a horrible precedent.  And we have many positive things to say, but we also have things that we want to turn into positives that are big negatives., The southern border is a very, very big deal.  It should’ve been handled by other Presidents for many times, just like Israel with the — if you look, moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  Every President talked about it; nobody did it until I came along.  Same thing in a certain, different way with the southern border.  It should’ve been stopped a long time ago.  They talked about it.  They had approvals for doing it, and they were unable to pull it off.  Other Presidents should’ve done this.  We’re going to do it.  And it’s not because I want to, it’s because I have no choice.  Because if we don’t do it, this country is going to be worse than any — at any time in our history in terms of drug infestation and in terms of crime.  And our crime numbers are really good, but our crime numbers would be very much better if we had a stopped-up southern border., And, by the way, the caravan now, they’re saying, is massive.  The caravan that’s coming up.  Thank you very much, Honduras.  We send Honduras hundreds of millions of dollars, and they send us caravans.  The three of those countries., And, you know, as I said, we’re probably going to be stopping that.  We’re working on that right now.  I would stop it.  Because, you know, you have two theories: You can give more and let them do economic development, or you can do less.  I’m of the less theory.  I don’t think we should give anything to them., And we’ve done this with numerous countries over the world where they’re not treating us right.  We have countries that get hundreds of millions of dollars — they don’t even vote for us at the United Nations, until we say we’re not going to pay you anymore, and then they immediately vote for us.  So, you know, but that’s not a — I don’t call that a vote., So I want to thank everybody very much.  We’re going to have a great meeting.  And we will have a response to Nancy Pelosi in due course.  But what she’s doing to the American people, what she is doing to our Constitution, is a disgrace.  Thank you very much., Thank you very much everybody., END                3:44 P.M.

       "7    [Cabinet Room, 3:07 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Good to have you all.  Hello, Chairman.  Great man, right here.  Might be another one right there.  We have some good ones.  We had a wonderful meeting on healthcare, yesterday, you probably know about, and so we’re moving along.  Hello, Thomas., Thank you very much for being here to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital safety and national security legislation., We’re joined by the Chairman of the House Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte, a friend of mine for a long time.  Bob is one of the most skilled legislators in Congress — and you didn’t even tell me to say that, Bob, right — (laughter) — and he’s worked with law enforcement to write a series of critical immigration bills that will close the dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, terrorists., MS-13 is a prime target.  They are bad people.  And we’ve gotten many of them out already.  You know, we’re pretty much at the 50 percent mark.  We’re getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we’re freeing up towns.  We’re actually liberating towns, if you can believe that we have to do that in the United States of America.  But we’re doing it, and we’re doing it fast., Also with us today are Congressman Peter King, another friend.  Lou Barletta — where’s Lou?  Lou, another friend.  So you’re running for governor, Lou?  Look behind you, Lou.  You can make a big announcement — (laughter.)  Lou Barletta, an early supporter.  Thank you, Lou.  And David Young., Tomorrow, the House will vote on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.  It’s been in the works for a long time.  People have wanted it, Bob, for a long time.  But we were able to get this process going, and I hope you’re going to be successful.  You’ll be successful, tomorrow, with the vote?, REPRESENTATIVE GOODLATTE:  We will., THE PRESIDENT:  Good — which will cut federal grant money to cities that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to federal law enforcement., The House will also vote on Kate’s Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant and who’s been deported five times.  This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly reenter the country illegally., Countless innocent Americans, including the loved ones of many families in the room — and many of these families are friends of mine — great friends of mine that I got to know over the campaign trail because they fought so hard for this.  And they are with us.  They’ve had members of their family killed by illegal immigrants and, really, people with multiple — in some cases, multiple deportations., I’m especially honored to be here with so many courageous families whom I did get to know so well over the past period of time.  You know, here’s one right over here.  Jamiel — a great, great man with a great son — great son, great family., You lost the people that you love because our government refused to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.  And that’s even the existing immigration laws, without new laws.  That’s existing immigration laws., For years, the pundits, journalists, politicians in Washington refused to hear your voices, but on Election Day, 2016, your voices were heard all across the entire world.  Right?  You better believe it.  Nobody died in vain, I can tell you., Chairman Goodlatte has produced a package of truly key immigration enforcement bills.  We’ve been waiting for these for a long time, and I want to thank you, Chairman, for doing that.  Great job.  And it’s just perfect., This package includes the Davis-Oliver Act, whose passage I called for nearly a year ago at my inauguration speech and immigration speech — both — the immigration speech taking place in Phoenix, Arizona.  The Davis-Oliver Act was named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, who were gunned down in the line of duty by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.  And everybody knew this person was big, big trouble, and they begged law enforcement to get him out.  And they were unable to do that., Their incredibly brave widows honored — and they’re here with us, by the way — we’re honoring them today.  And it’s honored — where are you please?  The widow — where is — they’re here someplace.  In the back of the room?  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you., We’re privileged to be joined by Melissa.  Melissa —, MS. OLIVER:  Right here., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what I thought.  Hello, Melissa.  (Laughter.)  Melissa Oliver.  And I just want to say that your father was a true hero — and you know that — and a great gentleman, and we miss him.  You miss him.  We miss him., We’re calling on all members of Congress to honor grieving American families by passing these lifesaving measures in the House, in the Senate, and then sending them to my desk for a very rapid signature.  I promise you, it will be done quickly.  You don’t have to wait the mandatory period.  It will be very quick, Melissa, in honor of your father and others, okay?  And in honor of Jamiel., MR. SHAW:  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  It’s time to support our police, to protect our families, and to save American lives.  And also to start getting smart., So with that, I’d like to ask each of the families invited, and some of the folks that I know that — and some I’ve gotten to know so well.  I’d like to start with Jamiel, to tell just a quick story about how great your son was, perhaps what happened, so that other people can learn by it.  I mean, your son was an incredible young man, incredible student and athlete.  Tell us about your son, Jamiel., END, \\n3:14 P.M.

       "11   [The President’s Weekly Address is now available to watch on , , , , and , ., My Fellow Americans,, Protecting the safety and well-being of American Citizens is my highest duty as President. Yet, lawless sanctuary jurisdictions are nullifying federal law, obstructing immigration enforcement, and releasing thousands of criminal aliens into U.S. communities to prey on innocent victims. It’s absolutely terrible., For example, in recent days, San Francisco officials denied ICE’s request to turn over a criminal alien with a prior conviction for battery and a charge for driving under the influence., In another city in California, local law enforcement recently denied ICE’s request to turn over a criminal alien convicted of Sexual Battery who had a history of domestic violence. A truly violent person., And last week, the mayor of Oakland warned criminal aliens of a coming ICE enforcement action – giving them time to scatter and hide from authorities.  The mayor’s conduct directly threatened the safety of federal immigration officers and the law-abiding Americans in her community., The State of California is sheltering dangerous criminals in a brazen and lawless attack on our Constitutional system of government.  Every state in our Union is subject to the laws and Constitution of the United States – including California.  Yet California’s leaders are in open defiance of federal law. They don’t care about crime. They don’t care about death and killings. They don’t care about robberies. They don’t care about the kind of things that you and I care about., In other recent cases, New York authorities released illegal aliens who were previously charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon, possession of poisonous drugs, and strangling a person – in each case, New York officials had refused to turn these dangerous illegal aliens over to ICE or notify ICE about their release with enough time for them to be safely arrested., Just this week, the city of Denver refused ICE’s request to turn over a criminal illegal alien charged with vehicular homicide for killing another driver in a horrific hit-and-run., Sanctuary jurisdictions are the best friend of smugglers, gang members, drug dealers, human traffickers, killers, and other violent offenders., We want our cities to be sanctuaries for Americans, not safe havens for criminals. That is why I am calling on Congress to block funds for jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminals., It is time to end the bloodshed brought about by reckless sanctuary policies – and it is time to save American lives and American cities., Thank you. God bless you.

       "13   [The President’s Weekly Address is now available to watch on , , , , and , ., My fellow Americans,, This week, prosecutors, law enforcement officers, homeland security officials, and lawmakers joined me at the White House to address a very vicious threat to our communities—the savage gang, MS-13., Glaring loopholes in our laws have allowed criminals and gang members to break into our country. For example, under current law, unaccompanied alien minors at the border are released into American communities no matter where, no matter how, it is so easy for them because the laws are bad and they have to be changed. This loophole is easily exploited by MS-13, which now operates in at least 40 states., In addition to MS-13, many other gangs are breaking into our country routinely because our laws are so weak, so sad, so pathetic., At this week’s roundtable, we learned the story of one family right here in Washington, D.C. that hosted a person in their home, who then began to recruit their young son to MS-13. When the boy’s mother tried to stop it, the gang member shot her in the head, blinding her for life. She’s lucky she lived, but she’s paying a very big price., During my State of the Union, I called on Congress to immediately close dangerous loopholes in federal law that have endangered our communities and imposed enormous burdens on U.S. taxpayers., My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Chain migration is a disaster and very unfair to our country. The visa lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place. People enter a lottery to come into our country. What kind of a system is that? It is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans. Every member of Congress should choose the side of law enforcement, and the side of the American People. That’s the way it has to be.]

       "15   [Walter E. Washington Convention Center, \\nWashington, D.C., 10:23 A.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, CUNA!  (Applause.)  And I want to say thank you to Jim Nussle.  Thank you for your kind introduction.  He’s been my friend of many years.  In our time together in the United States Congress, he served with great distinction as our Budget Chairman.  He served an administration as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  And now leading this vital organization in the life of this nation, Jim Nussle has made a difference expanding opportunities for American families.  Would you join me in thanking my friend, Jim Nussle, for his great leadership?  (Applause.), And it’s an honor to be here with all of you men and women who work hard every day to help Americans achieve the American Dream for their families, for their businesses.  You build local communities.  Credit unions are a part of everything good that is happening in cities large and small across this country.  And it’s my great honor to be here at the 2019 Government Affairs Conference of the Credit Union National Association.  Thank you so much for welcoming me here today.  (Applause.), And I want to give a special welcome to some great friends of mine from my time in the Congress, my time as a governor of the great state of Indiana.  We’ve got some Hoosiers in the house.  (Applause.)  John McKenzie, Dave Abernathy, all of you who are here with the Indiana Credit Union League: I am just delighted to see you all again., And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a great friend of credit unions and a great friend of all of you, and a man whose leadership has revived the economy of the United States of America.  I bring greetings from President Donald Trump to each and every one of you.  (Applause.), And I’m here today, on the President’s behalf and on behalf of our entire administration, really just to say, “thank you.”  Thanks to all of you for the vital role that you play in our nation, for the work you do to help millions of Americans build stronger families and build stronger businesses and stronger communities., The truth is, people that know members of this great association know you make it possible for American families to buy that next car, to send a child to college, buy that dream home.  You make it possible for countless entrepreneurs to start a small business and to help drive our economy., The men and women who run America’s credit unions — each one of you and all those you represent — you really do incredible work every day.  There’s really too many stories to tell today, but let me mention a few., Sara DeLance is here from Rutland, Vermont.  Sara, are you in the house?  (Applause.)  Fifteen years ago, I’m told, Sara took her first job as a part-time teller at her local credit union.  But today, because of her hard work, skill, and determination, Sara is a Senior Vice President at Heritage Family Credit Union.  And just last year, she was recognized for her outstanding service when Sara was named one of Vermont Business Magazine’s Rising Stars.  Now let’s hear it for Sara.  (Applause.), I’m also told that with us today is Maurice Smith, CEO of the Local Government Federal Credit Union in Raleigh, North Carolina.  In more than two decades of experience with credit unions, Maurice has earned many awards for his success.  But the impact of his work reaches far beyond the balance sheet., I’m actually told that Maurice makes a special effort to help credit union members whose incomes are more modest, like all of you do every single week across the country.  He treats every one of his clients, I’m told, as if they were his only client.  In fact, a longtime member of Maurice’s credit union recently said that, even years after she first joined, she, in her words, still feels like she’s the credit union’s “most important member.”, That’s the difference the personal impact — the personal touch that America’s credit unions make every single day in communities across America.  And I know each one of you are emblematic of that outstanding service., So join me in thanking Sara, Maurice, and every single one of you and your employees for your care and your diligence on behalf of the communities you serve.  (Applause.), It really is remarkable to think about the difference that credit unions make nationwide.  You serve 115 million Americans, with more than a stunning $1 trillion worth of loans., Over the past two years, you’ve also stood by the side of this President and this administration as we’ve fought to advance a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda., And just as we’re grateful to have you as our allies, you can be assured: The American credit unions have no greater champion than President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)  It’s true., You know, over the past two years, President Trump has signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history.  (Applause.)  Since Election Day, we’ve actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and business owners.  And, as all of you know, that also included their fundamental reform of the Dodd-Frank law.  (Applause.), As all of you know, Dodd-Frank restricted your members’ choices that limited the freedom of the American people to make financial decisions that were the best for them., Dodd-Frank made Washington bureaucrats more powerful and less accountable, giving them ever-more control over the work that you do every single day., It was, in every sense, a failed law that resulted in tens of thousands of pages of burdensome regulation — a mountain of red tape that created a tremendous burden on America’s credit unions and ultimately on the families and businesses that you serve., Since Dodd-Frank was passed into law nine years ago, the number of credit unions in America actually declined by more than 25 percent.  It was an average loss of one credit union each day., That’s why President Trump took action.  And with the support of majorities in the Congress, this President signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act into law, rolling back some of Dodd-Frank’s most damaging regulations.  (Applause.)  And you all were a part of that.  And your support in that effort made a tremendous difference, and you have our thanks on behalf of the American people that you serve., Now, credit unions understand the needs of your members far better than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. ever will.  And you showed that in the fight for that reform.  And under President Trump’s leadership, I want to promise you: Under this administration, we are going to continue to empower you to do what you do best: serving your members and serving growing communities across America.  (Applause.), But the truth is, we haven’t just been rolling back red tape on institutions like yours and on businesses large and small.  Under this President’s leadership, we’ve unleashed American energy as well — the lifeblood of our economy that fuels small businesses and family farms that credit unions support so much.  And thanks to our actions today, and thanks to the leadership of this President and the ingenuity of American energy entrepreneurs, today the United States is the world’s largest producer of oil and natural gas.  And next year, we will be a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years.  (Applause.), Under this President’s leadership, we’re also forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.  From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we’re negotiating deals that are free, fair, and reciprocal so working families and business owners can serve and can compete on the world stage., And, of course, with the support of all of you in this room and people all across the country, this President kept his promise to the American people before our first year was out when he signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history.  (Applause.), With the strong support of credit unions and your members around the country, we cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, family farms, and businesses of every size that credit unions serve.  And we made it possible for families and businesses to keep more of what they earn.  And the results of this agenda, as I’m sure you’ve witnessed on Main Street America, has been nothing short of extraordinary., Since Election Day, businesses large and small across America, in cities and towns, have seen businesses create 5.3 million new jobs, including 490,000 manufacturing jobs.  The American economy is roaring again.  (Applause.), Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.  And today, unemployment has hit a nearly 50-year low.  We’ve actually seen the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.  The truth is, the American Dream is working for every American once again, and credit unions are a part of making that happen.  (Applause.), It’s amazing to think more Americans are working today than ever before in our nation’s history.  A growing economy means more money for the families that you serve.  Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.  And it’s truly meaningful to the President and me that the most rapid growth of wages in America today is among blue-collar workers, the backbone of America.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  (Applause.), So we’ve made great progress.  The American economy is booming, and you all are a part of that extraordinary story of progress.  But as we gather here today in our nation’s capital, I want to assure you: In this administration, we understand that security is the foundation of our prosperity.  That’s why our administration has taken decisive action from our very first days to promote the safety and security of the American people., Yesterday, President Trump submitted his budget request to the Congress.  It called for fiscal discipline in discretionary domestic programs and a record investment in national defense and border security., As the President has said many times, “If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country.”, So as I stand before you today, all of you gathered here from all 50 states across this country, you deserve to know — whatever you hear in the national media — the truth is, we have a crisis on our southern border.  It’s a crisis of illegal immigration, drugs, dangerous criminals, and human trafficking.  And you also deserve to know that it’s a crisis like we’ve never seen before., For the first time ever, a majority of people attempting to come into our country through our southern border illegally are families and unaccompanied minors that are being enticed to make the long and dangerous journey from Central America by drug cartels and human traffickers who take advantage of our porous border and loopholes in our laws to encourage people to pay cash to be taken up to our border., As the President has said, in his words, “These are heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings…on both sides of the border.”, The truth is, 70 percent of illegal immigrants report being victims of violence on their journey to our southern border.  And according to Doctors Without Borders, nearly one-third of women traveling to our southern border report being sexually assaulted on the journey., Now, just last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced that, in the last five months alone, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of families apprehended compared to the same period one year ago.  My fellow Americans, every day we don’t secure our border, we are allowing the crisis to worsen and more lives to be endangered and exploited., And despite the incredible work that our men and women in law enforcement are doing, drug cartels and smugglers are exploiting this crisis at our southern border to flood drugs into our country, harming our children and our families and the communities where you live and lead., It’s heartbreaking to acknowledge that, today, drug overdose is the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age.  In 2016, all across America, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day., These statistics don’t tell the story better than I know you already know it, because I know the role that credit unions play in your communities.  You’re involved in every worthy cause, in every charity.  You are an integral part of your communities.  And so when the stories are told of heartbreak, you’ve already heard those stories., A member of the United States Senate from the American northwest told me not long ago — he said, “Mike, I’m standing strong with the President for border security.”  He said, “Because we don’t have a crisis on our southern border.”  He said, “We have a crisis in all 50 states of opiate abuse and addiction, and it’s time for America to act.”  (Applause.), The crisis on our southern border is affecting us all.  It’s affecting every community in America.  That’s why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security, declared a national emergency on our southern border., Despite the fact that he has clear statutory authority under the National Emergencies Act, some in Congress are actually trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress gave him to address what is an undeniable humanitarian crisis on our southern border., Now, we’re grateful for senators who are working to find a way to address this crisis and support the President’s emergency declaration for border security.  And after I leave you today, I’ll travel to Capitol Hill to continue those discussions., But let me say this: A vote against the President’s emergency declaration is a vote against border security.  A vote against the President’s emergency declaration is a vote to deny the real humanitarian and security crisis that is happening at our southern border., And so we’re calling on every member of the United States Senate: Set politics aside.  Stand up for border security.  Stand with this President.  And put the safety and security of the American people first.  (Applause.), And I know many of you are headed to Capitol Hill in the days ahead.  When I was a member of Congress, I always looked forward to my credit union leaders coming in.  I know you’ll be talking about economic issues in your community.  But you serve families.  It’s one of the things that makes credit unions so special., And so I encourage each one of you, as you meet with representatives in the House and Senate, just encourage them to take a stand for border security.  Encourage them to stand with this President as he’s taking such decisive action to secure our border., And once we’ve secured our border, I promise you we will work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system once and for all.  (Applause.)  We’ll do it., So as I close, let me just say “thank you” once again to all of you for all you’ve done to bring opportunities and prosperity to American families., I know what you do.  You know, I’m a small-town guy from southern Indiana.  I know the difference that credit unions make in communities large and small across this country.  In my hometown, you know, there was never a Little League Baseball game, there was a never a high school function, there was never a local charity, or a church event where you didn’t see the local credit union banner hanging back on the fence.  You all are always there and you make a difference.  And you’re to be commended for that., And in the days ahead, I just want to assure you that we’re going to keep working to make sure this nation continues to grow and thrive; that you continue to sit down with those members and help them achieve their dreams for themselves and for their family, and their children and their children’s children., And at this time in the life of our nation, I have to tell you, the work that each one of us are doing couldn’t be more important.  And, frankly, the choice we face couldn’t be clearer.  You know, it is remarkable to think — as we gather in the midst of this extraordinary prosperity, in the most prosperous nation on Earth, built on free enterprise, built on that American Dream — many of the leading voices in the other party are actually advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world., Under the guise of what’s called Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, liberals in Washington and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and have stifled the liberties of millions.  That system is socialism., The truth is, what they’re actually offering is more — just more of the same: more government, more taxes, more spending, and less freedom., The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none.  And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it’s going to cost all of us if they ever pass it into law.  (Applause.), You know, Margaret Thatcher had it right.  She said, quote, “The trouble with Socialism is [you] eventually run out of other people’s money.”  (Applause.), You know, President Trump said it well in his State of the Union Address.  He said, “America was founded on liberty and independence, and not [on] government coercion, domination, and control.”  (Applause.), And so in the days ahead, I urge each and every one of you who make the American Dream happen, go out there and also tell members why it’s happening.  It’s because of freedom, free enterprise that gives us the opportunity to live our dreams., I believe with all my heart the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment that America ceases to be America.  So we must say, with one voice, as President Trump said before the Congress, “America will never be a socialist country.”  (Applause.), So to all the leaders gathered here today: Thank you again.  Thank you for what each and every one of you do to come alongside families in your communities, to be there and to strengthen everything that makes America strong and prosperous.  You stand alongside hardworking people that are living the American Dream.  You build great communities., And I just encourage you in the days ahead, whether it be standing for border security or standing up for those timeless American ideals, let you voice be heard., And I’ll promise you, the President and I are going to keep on fighting for all the principles and policies that you’ve supported not just over the last two years, but as so many of you have supported throughout your lifetimes and the lifetime of this movement., The truth is, it’s going to take all of us in the days ahead to keep America growing, to keep America on the pathway of the principles that are restoring American greatness each and every day., And so I want to encourage each and every one of you, as I go, to let your voice be heard not just on Capitol Hill this week, but when you go back home.  Recognize that you’re leaders in your community., You know, I’ll always believe that all the cable TV shows in the world, all of the social media, all the mail pieces and TV ads in political campaigns don’t matter a hill of beans than when somebody that you know and respect in a community speaks up about issues that are important to your family, or to the community, or the state or the nation.  So we encourage you, just let your voice be heard in the days ahead., And lastly, just continue to stand with those families. I’ve seen it firsthand.  It has always been touching to me that credit unions don’t have clients; you have members.  They’re communities, and they’re born of the great tradition of associations that’s always been the heart of America.  People coming together to find solutions with one another, to build on the principles of free enterprise and opportunity and individual responsibility., And so just keep doing what you’re doing.  Keep believing in the communities that you’re serving.  Keep believing in those people that come in nervously with their hands wringing, and they sit across the table from you and they tell you about their dream.  And keep investing in the American Dream., In a word: Have faith.  Have faith that, when given the opportunity and the freedom, the American people demonstrate each and every day that this is a nation where dreams come true.  Credit union members make that happen.  But also, I encourage you to continue to demonstrate the faith that I’ve seen characterized in so many credit union leaders over the years, and faith that each and every one of us are precious in the sight of God.  Each and every one of us, when given the opportunity, can achieve our dreams., Because those words written so long ago are still just as true today for each and every person you meet.  They’re over the mantle in our house at the Vice President’s Residence, and they continue to guide our little family.  For I know the plans I have for you — plans to prosper you, not to harm you; plans to give you a hope and a future., With faith in Him who promises a hope and a future to all our people, I say “thank you.”  Thank you for your service.  Keep up the great work.  And God Bless you all.  (Applause.), END, 10:50 A.M.



       "18   [Cabinet Room, 11:39 A.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, everyone, for being here.  I’m thrilled to be with a distinguished group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers from both the House and the Senate.  We have something in common, we’d like to see this get done, and you know what this means., We are here today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves the needs of the American families, workers, and taxpayers.  It’s DACA.  We’ve been talking about DACA for a long time.  I’ve been hearing about it for years, long before I decided to go into this particular line of work.  And maybe we can do something., We have a lot of good people in this room.  A lot of people that have a great spirit for taking care of the people we represent — we all represent.  For that reason, any legislation on DACA, we feel — at least a strong part of this group feels — has to accomplish three vital goals., And Chairman Goodlatte will be submitting a bill over the next two to three days that will cover many of the things.  And, obviously, that will — if it gets passed, it will go to the Senate and we can negotiate and we’ll see how it turns out.  But I feel having the Democrats in with us is absolutely vital because it should be a bipartisan bill.  It should be a bill of love.  Truly, it should be a bill of love, and we can do that., But it also has to be a bill where we’re able to secure our border.  Drugs are pouring into our country at a record pace and a lot of people are coming in that we can’t have.  We’ve greatly stiffened, as you know, and fewer people are trying to come in., But we have tremendous numbers of people and drugs pouring into our country., So, in order to secure it, we need a wall.  We need closing enforcement — we have to close enforcement loopholes.  Give immigration officers — and these are tremendous people, the border security agents, the ICE agents — we have to give them the equipment they need, we have to close loopholes, and this really does include a very strong amount of different things for border security., I think everybody in the room would agree to that.  I think that we — it’s a question of the amounts.  But I think everyone agrees we have to have border security.  I don’t think there would be anybody that says “no.”, Second, it has to be a bill to end chain migration.  Chain migration is bringing in many, many people with one, and often it doesn’t work out very well.  Those many people are not doing us right.  And I think a lot of people in the room — and I’m not sure I can speak for everybody, but a lot of the people in this room want to see chain migration ended., And we have a recent case along the West Side Highway, having to do with chain migration, where a man ran over — killed eight people and many people injured badly.  Loss of arms, loss of legs.  Horrible thing happened, and then you look at the chain and all of the people that came in because of him.  Terrible situation., And the other is — cancel the lottery program.  They call it “visa lottery,” I just call it “lottery.”  But countries come in and they put names in a hopper.  They’re not giving you their best names; common sense means they’re not giving you their best names.  They’re giving you people that they don’t want.  And then we take them out of the lottery.  And when they do it by hand — where they put the hand in a bowl — they’re probably — what’s in their hand are the worst of the worst., But they put people that they don’t want into a lottery and the United States takes those people.  And again, they’re going back to that same person who came in through the lottery program.  They went — they visited his neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood said, “oh my God, we suffered with this man — the rudeness, the horrible way he treated us right from the beginning.”  So we don’t want the lottery system or the visa lottery system.  We want it ended., So those three things are paramount.  These are measures that will make our community safer and more prosperous.  These reforms are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans.  They’re from every standpoint, from every poll, and they’re being requested by law enforcement officers., I had the big meeting with ICE last week; I had a big meeting with the Border Patrol agents last week.  Nobody knows it better than them.  As an example, on the wall, they say, “sir, we desperately need the wall.”, And we don’t need a 2,000-mile wall.  We don’t need a wall where you have rivers and mountains and everything else protecting it.  But we do need a wall for a fairly good portion.  We also — as you know, it was passed in 2006 — a essentially similar thing, which — a fence, a very substantial fence was passed.  But, unfortunately, I don’t know, they never got it done.  But they need it., So I’m appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party, and to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and let’s see if we can get something done.  I really think that we have a chance to do it.  I think it’s very important.  You’re talking about 800,000 people — and we’re talking about lots of other people are also affected, including people that live in our country.  That’s from the security standpoint., So maybe the press can stay for a little while and a couple of folks can make statements and I don’t mind the statements.  We want to have this as a very open forum.  I will say, though, that I really do believe Democratic and Republican — the people sitting around this table — want to get something done in good faith.  And I think we’re on our way to do it., This was an idea I had last week.  I was sitting with some of our great Republican senators and we all agreed on everything.  It was a great meeting.  Right?  David, right?  We had a great meeting — Tom.  It was perfect., Then I said, “yeah, but we’d like to get some Democrats.  Well, what do they say?”  And I say, “let’s have the same meeting, but let’s add the Democrats.”  And that’s what we’ve done.  And I think we’re going to come up with an answer.  I hope we’re going to come up with an answer for DACA, and then we go further than that later on down the road., Dick, perhaps you’d like to say a few words?, SENATOR DURBIN:  Thanks, Mr. President, for inviting us.  We’re all honored to be a part of this conversation., September the 5th, you challenged us.  You challenged Congress.  You said we’re going to end DACA, not replace it.  As of today, we have not done that.  We face a deadline of March 5th, which you created with your elimination of DACA, and we know that, in the meantime, there have been efforts underway by Senator Graham and I., We sat down with a bipartisan group of senators.  We have worked long and hard, many hours have been put into it.  And we feel that we can put together a combination for the future of DACA as well as border security, and that there are elements you’re going to find Democrats support when it comes to border security.  We want a safe border in America, period, both when it comes to the issues of illegal migration, but also when it comes to drugs and all these other areas., Now, I will say that there is a sense of urgency that’s felt by many of us when it comes to this issue.  There are many of these young people who are losing the protection of DACA on a daily basis.  As of March 5th, a thousand a day will lose DACA protection.  Nine hundred of them are members of the U.S. military.  Twenty thousand of them are schoolteachers.  In my state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, there are 25 of them in medical school who can’t apply for a residency if they lose their DACA status., So lives are hanging in the balance of our getting the job done.  We’ve got the time to do it.  In a matter of days — literally of days — we can come together and reach an agreement.  And when that happens, I think good things will happen in other places.  And we’ll see some progress in Washington., THE PRESIDENT: I agree with that, Dick.  I very much agree with that.  Tom, would you like to say something?  Tom Cotton., SENATOR COTTON:  Thank you for inviting us all here and I’m glad to be here with Democrats and with House members as well.  You know, I think, on this issue, there’s a lack of trust and has been, for many years, a lack of trust between Republicans and Democrats; a lack of trust among Republicans; most fundamentally, a lack of trust between the American people and our elected leaders on not delivering a solution for many, many years about some of these problems., And I hope that this meeting can be the beginning of building trust between our parties, between the chambers, because I know, for fact, all the Republicans around the table are committed to finding a solution, and I believe all the Democrats are as well., So I think this is a good first step in building the trust we need for a good bill, Mr. President, that will achieve the objectives that you stated: providing legal protection for the DACA population, while also securing our border and ending chain migration and the diversity lottery., Thank you for the invitation., REPRESENTATIVE HOYER:  Mr. President, thank you very much for having us down here.  I agree with Tom Cotton that the American public are very frustrated with us.  One of the reasons they’re frustrated with us is because we continue to couple things on which we have large agreement with things in which we do not agree.  This is a perfect example of that., Eighty-six percent of the American people in the most recent poll are for ensuring, as you have said, not providing for DACA-protected kids to go to a place that they don’t know, they didn’t grow up in, and it’s not their home.  They’re Americans.  They don’t have a piece of paper that says they’re Americans, but they’re Americans., And it seems to me, Mr. President, if we’re going to move ahead in a constructive way, that we take that on which we agree — pass it.  The American public will be pleased with all of us if we do that.  Just as, in September, you recall, we did the extension of the CR.  No drama.  We were all for it.  You and the four leaders met, we came to an agreement, and we passed that CR., In my view, we can pass the protection in the — well, I understand your position is procedurally it was not done correctly.  You then, as Dick has said, challenged us — pass it correctly., If it’s put on the floor, Mr. President, I believe we will have the overwhelming majority in both the House — and Senator Graham thinks that we’ll have a substantial majority in the United States Senate as well.  That, I think, is the first step, Tom, to creating some degree of confidence., Democrats are for security at the borders; I want to state that emphatically.  There is not a Democrat that is not for having secure borders., There are obviously differences however, Mr. President, on how you effect that.  You just indicated that yourself.  And you indicated this would be a first step, and then we continue to talk as we’re talking today about how we best secure the border.  There are differences of opinion within your party and within in our party., So I would urge that we move forward on protecting the DACA-protected individuals — young people, young adults, as you pointed out in one of your statements — who are productive parts of our community — that we protect them and get that done.  And then, because I think everybody around the table, as you pointed out, is for security — and then the issue is going to be how do we best effect that border security., So I would urge us to move, as Senator Durbin has urged us to move, on the DACA students.  As a matter of fact, the Speaker, I think today, but maybe yesterday, said, we need to solve the DACA issue, and we need to solve it in a way that is permanent, not temporary.  And I agree with him on that issue., THE PRESIDENT:  And, interestingly, when you say that, President Obama, when he signed the executive order, actually said he doesn’t have the right to do this.  And so you do have to go through Congress, and you do have to make it permanent, whether he does, whether he doesn’t — let’s assume he doesn’t, he said it — and that was a temporary stopgap, I don’t think we want that.  I think we want to have a permanent solution to this.  And I think everybody in this room feels that way very strongly., REPRESENTATIVE HOYER:  What happened, Mr. President, I think, is that the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill, as you know.  We did not consider it in the House, so we didn’t reach those issues., Very frankly, on border security, Mr. McCaul, the Chairman of the committee, reported out a unanimous security solution, which we then included in the bill that we filed on comprehensive immigration reform.  So I think we can reach agreement., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I also think that, after we do DACA — and I really believe we should be able to be successful — I really think we should look in terms of your permanent solution and to the whole situation with immigration.  I think a lot of people in this room would agree to that also, but we’ll do it in steps.  And most people agree with that, I think, that we’ll do the steps.  Even you say, ‘let’s do this, and then we go phase two.’, Kevin, what would you like to say?, REPRESENTATIVE MCCARTHY:  Well, first, I want to thank you for bringing everybody together.  You got the Senate, you got the House, you got both parties.  And I like the exchange of ideas, and I think everybody has a point here., The one thing I don’t want to have happen here is what I saw in the past.  There were four bills that were passed on border security years ago that never got finished.  There were immigration bills passed that — we’re right back at the table with the same problem.  Let’s make a commitment to each one, and, most importantly, to the American people, that, when we get done and come to an agreement, that we’re not back at this problem three, four years from now., That’s why — yes, we’ve got to do DACA, and I agree with you 100 percent — but if we do not do something with the security, if we do not do something with the chain migration, we are fooling each other that we solved the problem.  You know how difficult this issue is.  So let’s collectively — we’re here at the table together.  I’ll be the first one to tell you, we’re all going to have to give a little, and I’ll be the first one willing to., But let’s solve the problem — but let’s not tell the American public at the end that it’s solved when it’s not., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think a good starting point would be Bob Goodlatte, who has done a bill, and I understand you’re ready to submit it.  And you’re going to take that and you’ll submit it and they’ll negotiate it in Congress or the House.  And then it goes to the Senate, and they’ll negotiate — both Republican and Democrat.  But it could be a good way of starting., Now, if anyone has an idea different from that — but, I think, starting in the House.  Starting in the House — Mike, you good?  You’re ready.  I think you’re ready to go., REPRESENTATIVE MCCAUL:  We are, Mr. President., THE PRESIDENT:  I would like to add the words “merit” into any bill that’s submitted because I think we should have merit-based immigration like they have in Canada, like they have in Australia.  So we have people coming in that have a great track record, as opposed to what we’re doing now, to be honest with you., But I think merit-based should be absolutely added to any bill, even if it has to do with DACA.  That would be added to the things I said.  I think it would be popular.  I can tell you, the American public very much wants that., But, Bob, where are you with the bill?, REPRESENTATIVE GOODLATTE:  So, tomorrow, Chairman McCaul and Congresswoman McSally and Congressman Labrador — we’re the chairmen of the two committees and the chairmen of the two subcommittees — are going to introduce a bill that addresses the DACA concerns., And let me thank you, Mr. President, both — I was an immigration lawyer before I was elected to Congress.  I want to thank you both for campaigning on securing our borders and the interior of our country, but also on addressing DACA in a way that makes sense.  Don’t do it ad hoc; do it through the congressional process.  So you’ve challenged us, and we should step up to that challenge.  And we’re going to do it in a bipartisan fashion, but we have to put our best foot forward., And we’re going to do that with this legislation.  It’s going to address DACA in a permanent way, not a temporary short-term thing.  We’re going to address the border enforcement and security and the wall.  We’re going to address — in Mr. McCaul’s bill, we’re going to address interior enforcement, but not everything that the administration had on its list., We’re going to address chain migration.  We’re going to end the visa lottery program.  We’re going to address sanctuary cities and Kate’s Law., We think it is a good bill that will both address the two things our Speaker told us right after you made your decision, which is, we have to address the problem we have with the DACA kids being in limbo, as Dick Dubin described it, and I agree with that.  But we also have to make sure this does not happen again., THE PRESIDENT:  And, Dick, you and the Democrats are going to have a lot of things that they’re not going to agree — you’re going to talk to us about it.  I just felt that this is something that was long overdue.  You’d have a meeting and you’d say, this is what we want.  We’d have a meeting — and this has been going on for years.  And I just — you know, at a certain point, maybe I’ll just lock the doors and I won’t let anybody out — (laughter) — until they come and agree., Michael, do you have something to say about the bill?, REPRESENTATIVE MCCAUL:  Yes, I’ve been in Congress for seven terms.  I’ve been trying to get this border secure for seven terms in Congress.  I think this is a bipartisan issue.  I think DACA is a bipartisan issue., We have an opportunity, I think, before us to get this done for the American people.  When it comes to chain migration and the lottery system, we saw two recent terror attacks in New York that were the result of this, I think, failed immigration policy.  We’d like to see that fixed for the American people and along with, as Bob talked about, sanctuary cities., Now, you and I talked about this extensively.  So we think our bill, our House bill would be a good starting ground for this negotiation.  And I, too, want to commend you for bringing everybody together., I think what we don’t want to see happen is for the conditions for DACA to occur again.  We want to get security done so we don’t have to deal with this problem five more years down the road., So thank you, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are so many points of agreement, and a lot of it is common sense.  And I really think we’re going to come out very well., David Perdue, do you have something to say?, REPRESENTATIVE PERDUE:  Well, yeah, my observation is that three times in the last eleven years, well-intentioned people, some of whom are in this room, attempted to do what we’re starting to try to do today, and we failed.  And I think the difference is, is their mission creep ended up in an effort that became too comprehensive., And so, today, my encouragement for all of us is to do what Dick has been trying to do and talks about repeatedly, and that is to limit the scope of this.  And I like the idea that both sides have pressure to solve the DACA issue.  But I think the bigger issue here is not just the DACA issue, but what we can do to start the path to the steps that solve this immigration problem.  For several reasons — there are social issues; there are political issues; there are economic issues about our workforce that have to be addressed., But limiting this to the legal immigration side and combining the balance between various solutions on DACA; DREAMers, if it gets in the conversation; as well border security and chain migration, I think therein lies the balance of a good deal that can be done., And I don’t think — I agree with Dick.  I don’t think it’s going to take long to get it done if we just lock ourselves in a room and make it happen., THE PRESIDENT:  I think you’re right.  I think it could be done very quickly., Would anybody have anything to say prior to the press leaving?, REPRESENTATIVE MCSALLY:  Mr. President, I just have one comment., THE PRESIDENT:  Yes., REPRESENTATIVE MCSALLY:  Senator Durbin mentioned that lives are hanging in the balance.  As we come up on the January 19th deadline, the lives that are hanging in the balance are those of our military that are needing the equipment and the funding and everything they need in order to keep us safe, and we should not playing politics on this issue to stop our military from getting the funding that they need., I think we have the right people in the room to solve this issue.  The deadline is March 5th.  Let’s roll up our sleeves and work together on this.  But those who need us right now before the January 19 deadline is our military.  And let’s not play politics with that.  Let’s give them what they need to keep us safe., THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.  And I think a lot of people would agree with that.  We need our military — I can’t say more than ever before.  We had wars.  Right, Lindsey?  We had a lot of other areas and times.  But we need our military desperately.  Our military has been very depleted.  We’re rebuilding, and we’re building it up quickly, and we’re negotiating much better deals with your purveyors and with your manufacturers and with your equipment-makers — much better than it was before., I looked at boats that started off at $1.5 billion, and they’re up to $18 billion, and they’re still not finished.  In this case, a particular aircraft carrier.  I think it’s outrageous.  So we’re very much agreeing with you on that one., Would anybody like to say?  Yes, Steny, go ahead., REPRESENTATIVE HOYER:  I want to follow up on that.  There are no Democrats that don’t want to make sure that the military is funded properly.  And over the last four years, we had an agreement between Mr. Ryan and Senator Murray — Speaker Ryan and — that we understand that our military is critically important.  But we also understand that our domestic issues, whether it’s education, whether it’s healthcare, whether it’s environment, whether it’s transportation and infrastructure, they’re important, as well., And both the defense and non-defense sides of the budget are hurt when you have a CR, because they cannot blink and they cannot get contracts if they don’t have any money to do so.  So that, very frankly, I think Ms. McSally is correct.  But what we ought to have done over the last six months — particularly when we did the September and we gave 90 days — is to reach some agreement on what the caps are going to be.  The Murray-Ryan agreements were parity.  We believe that’s very important., So we can get to where we should get and want to get there, but we ought to have an agreement based upon what the last —, THE PRESIDENT:  But, Steny, we do have to take politics out of the military.  We need that military.  All the other things we talk about, we’re not going to be here if we don’t have the right military.  And we need our military, and we need it stronger than ever before, and we’re ready to do it.  But we have to take politics out of the military., One thing that I think we can really get along with on a bipartisan basis — and maybe I’m stronger on this than a lot of the people on the Republican side, but I will tell you, we have great support from the Republicans — is infrastructure.  I think we can do a great infrastructure bill.  I think we’re going to have a lot of support from both sides, and I’d like to get it done as quickly as possible., Yes, John., SENATOR CORNYN:  Mr. President, I, too, want to thank you for getting us together.  You made the point last week when Republicans were meeting with you that, why are we continuing to have these meetings just among ourselves when what we need to do to get to a solution is to meet, as we are today, as you insisted, on bipartisan basis., But part of my job is to count votes in the Senate.  And as you know when you hosted us, the leadership, at Camp David this weekend, I believe both the Speaker and Majority Leader McConnell made crystal clear that they would not proceed with a bill on the floor of the Senate or the House unless it had your support, unless you would sign it., So that’s, I think, the picture we need to be looking through — the lens we need to be looking through is not only what could we agree to among ourselves on a bipartisan basis, but what will you sign into law.  Because we all want to get to a solution here, and we realize the clock is ticking., But I think that for me frames the issue about as well as I can., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Very well said.  One of the reasons I’m here, Chuck, so importantly, is exactly that.  I mean, normally you wouldn’t have a President coming to this meeting.  Normally, frankly, you’d have Democrats, Republicans, and maybe nothing would get done., Our system lends itself to not getting things done, and I hear so much about earmarks — the old earmark system — how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks.  But of course, they had other problems with earmarks.  But maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.  Because this system — (laughter) —, PARTICIPANT:  Yes, yes, yes.  (Laughter.), THE PRESIDENT:  This system — (laughter) — but you should do it, and I’m there with you, because this system really lends itself to not getting along.  It lends itself to hostility and anger, and they hate the Republicans.  And they hate the Democrats.  And in the old days of earmarks, you can say what you want about certain Presidents and others, where they all talk about they went out to dinner at night and they all got along, and they passed bills.  That was an earmark system, and maybe we should think about it., And we have to put better controls because it got a little bit out of hand, but maybe that brings people together.  Because our system right now, the way it’s set up, will never bring people together., Now, I think we’re going to get this done — DACA.  I think we’re going to get — I hope we’re going to get infrastructure done in the same way., But I think you should look at a form of earmarks.  I see Lindsey nodding very hard “yes.”, ...]

Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov, the alleged perpetrator of the Halloween day attack in New York City, came to the United States from Uzbekistan via the “visa lottery.”, …, The visa lottery awards 50,000 green cards to foreign nationals with absolutely no ties to the U.S. and no special skills, through a computer-generated random drawing. According to the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, almost 1,900 aliens from state sponsors of terrorism were selected in the 2005 visa lottery., …, This is not a program in America’s best interests., Chain migration is another feature of our immigration system that does nothing to help America and its legal citizens., …, While a formal amnesty for illegal immigrants has been debated on Capitol Hill, we already have a de facto amnesty program in the form of chain migration. President Trump announced that Saipov, through chain migration, alone brought 23 family members to the United States with him. Chain migration has deemed over three million immigrants eligible, but many must wait because of category limitations. This has served as a driver for illegal immigration, as these applicants choose not to wait for the U.S. immigration bureaucracy to process them., …, A Pulse Opinion Research poll taken over the summer showed a majority of likely midterm voters support ending the visa lottery., …, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) have introduced the RAISE Act, which would, among other objectives, end the visa lottery program and refocus immigration policy in terms of merit, not need. In light of the carnage in his home state, will Schumer and others in his camp see the error of their ways and support legislation that protects American citizens?

       "20   [South Court Auditorium, \\nEisenhower Executive Office Building, 2:40 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  We actually spent some time together, so I didn’t mind giving you a second “hello.”  Not at all.  We’ve known each other a long time.  We’ve been friends for a long time, from the beginning of the campaign.  And these are special people., Please, sit down., Vice President Pence — thank you very much for joining us, Mike.  I also want to recognize Acting Director Homan, who’s leaving us.  He’s been truly a star.  And he’s leaving.  He’s retiring.  But where is Tom?  Is he around here someplace?  Tom.  Stand up, Tom.  (Applause.)  Tom has been doing what he’s doing for 34 years and doing it with strength and dedication.  And you are really outstanding, and your highly recommended replacement is going to do a great job.  We know him well.  He’s going to do really great.  Thank you, Tom, for those years of service., I also want to thank the incredible ICE Officers, Border Patrol agents, and law enforcement officials who join us here today.  If you could stand up, please.  These people are also special people.  (Applause.)  And they’re good-looking people.  Aren’t they?  Huh?  (Laughter.)  Good-looking people.  Thank you very much for being here and for the bravery.  What you do and what you endure is incredible., I also want to stand and have the brave men and women from all over government agencies — we have a lot — maybe just raise your hand or stand.  But we really appreciate the job that you’ve done, especially during the last year and a half, because I know you’ve really put in a lot of extra.  So, please.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.), We’re gathered today to hear directly from the American victims of illegal immigration.  You know, you hear the other side.  You never hear this side.  You don’t know what’s going on.  These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones — the word “permanently” being the word that you have to think about — “permanently.”  They’re not separated for a day or two days.  These are permanently separated, because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens., These are the families the media ignores.  They don’t talk about them.  Very unfair.  We have to look at everybody.  But this is a very unfair situation.  And I knew that years ago when we would be together out campaigning.  And I said, “If this ever happens, we’re never forgetting you.”  You know that, Laura, everybody.  Incredible people.  And they’re dedicated., These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration, they don’t want to discuss, they don’t want to hear, they don’t want to see, they don’t want to talk about.  No major networks sent cameras to their homes or displayed the images of their incredible loved ones across the nightly news.  They don’t do that.  They don’t talk about the death and destruction caused by people that shouldn’t be here, people that will continuously get into trouble and do bad things., For years, their pain was met with silence; their plight was met with indifference.  But no more.  I told them three years ago when we were together, from day one — just about day one I would say — I said, “I hear you, I see you, and I will never let you down.”  And we’ve been working together, and their loved ones have not died in vain.  We all know that., We call these brave Americans the Angel Families — Angel moms, Angel pops.  These are the Angel Families.  Your loss will not have been in vain.  We will secure our borders.  And we will make sure that they’re properly taken care of eventually.  The word will get out.  We’ve got to have a safe country.  We’re going to have a safe country.  And your loved ones are going to be playing and will continue to play a big part in it.  You know that, right?  You know that., So here are just a few statistics on the human toll of illegal immigration.  According to a 2011 government report, the arrests attached to the criminal alien population included an estimated 25,000 people for homicide, 42,000 for robbery, nearly 70,000 for sex offenses, and nearly 15,000 for kidnapping., In Texas alone, within the last seven years, more than a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 criminal offenses.  You don’t hear that.  I always hear that, “Oh, no, the population is safer than the people that live in the country.”  You’ve heard that, fellas.  Right?  You’ve heard that.  I hear it so much.  And I say, “Is that possible?”  The answer is it’s not true.  You hear it’s like they’re better people than what we have — than our citizens.  It’s not true., In 2016, more than 15,000 Americans died from a heroin overdose.  More than 90 percent of the heroin comes from across the southern border.  Ninety percent., As a result of sanctuary city policies, in Fiscal 2017, more than 8,000 criminal aliens — these are really hardcore criminal aliens — were in police custody and were released because of our weak laws.  Weakest in the world.  Weakest in the history of the world.  They were released back into our civilian population.  And these gentlemen had to do some of the releasing, and I don’t think you were too happy when you knew.  Because you knew — they know better than anybody.  You knew what you were releasing.  You knew it was trouble.  And it often comes back to be trouble., Where is the media outrage over the catch-and-release policies that allow deadly drugs to pour into our country?  Where is the condemnation of the Democrat sanctuary cities that release violent criminals into our communities and then protect them?  Like the Mayor of San Diego, when she warned everybody that ICE is coming, and they scattered.  A big operation.  A very expensive operation.  They were all together.  They all scattered.  And what are they going to do about looking at her, by the way?  I’ve been asking this question now for four weeks.  She can do that?  And where is the outcry over the savage gang MS-13 and its bloodthirsty creed, “Kill, Rape, and Control”?, Because the news media has overlooked their stories, I want the American people to hear directly from these families about the pain they have had to endure, losing not only their loved ones — great people.  Great Americans.  People that would have been very successful.  People that, in some cases, could have been here one day.  Could have been here.  I know the way you feel.  But could have been right here, standing here., First, I’d like to ask a friend of mine, for now a long time, Laura Wilkerson from Pearland, Texas, to come and share her story about her incredible, incredible boy.  Right?, MS. WILKERSON:  Yes., THE PRESIDENT:  Come on, Laura.  Just say a few words., MS. WILKERSON:  We want to tell you a little bit today about Josh.  He was brutally tortured, strangled over and over.  He was set on fire after death.  His last hours were — was brutal.  As everyone standing up here, none of our kids had a minute to say goodbye.  We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for 5 days or 10 days.  We’re separated permanently.  Any time we want to see or be close to our kids, we go to the cemetery, because that’s where they are.  We can never speak to them.  We can’t Skype with them.  And I want to thank you so much, in this room, for what you’re doing to understand — you guys know the permanent separation.  It’s the media that won’t share it with other people.  It’s permanent.  We can never have them back on this Earth.  Thankfully, I’ll see him again in Heaven., But I want to thank you, Mr. Trump, and Vice President Trump for — I mean, Vice President Pence — for keeping their commitment to us.  It’s been ongoing.  It continues on.  And please understand there are so many more of us than what you see here that have the same story.  Over and over — drunk driving, killed.  Over and over.  And they don’t prosecute, or they’re let go on low bond.  They’re out in 30 days.  It’s sad for our country and it’s time to take it back., And I want to thank each and every one of you law enforcement.  You know it.  You love it, you want to do your jobs.  And thankfully, we have a President who will allow you to do that now.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Laura., Next, I’d like to ask Juan Piña from Greenfield, California to speak.  Juan, please come up.  Thank you.  Thank you, Juan., MR. PIÑA:  My name is Juan Piña.  First of all, I want to thank the Remembrance Project for bringing my daughter’s name out to light, and for candidate Trump to let me speak about her.  And I’ve got a lot of people that I need to thank., My daughter was Christy Sue Piña.  Back in 1990, she was kidnapped, strangled, stabbed, raped, and sodomized, and her body was found in an artichoke field.  I’ve been fighting for twenty-eight and a half years.  He’s been fighting.  He was loose for 25.  The last three and a half years he’s been fighting extradition., And on May 3rd, God answered my prayers and Mexico finally turned him loose to us.  And he is now in the Monterey County Jail and we can start court procedures for my daughter’s death., And I want to thank everybody that was involved in getting him over here, the sheriff department of Monterey County for the investigator.  The sheriff never told her, “Don’t give up on this.  Just stay on it, and stay on it.”  And she pinky swore that she was going to get him over there, and she did., And I just want to thank the President and everybody.  And I just hope   everybody can get what I just got.  And I’m out here speaking for the thousands of victims that we have here in the United States.  And I want to thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  So Juan fought for many years, and it’s hard to believe but that’s actually a great feeling., MR. PIÑA:  Yes, it is., THE PRESIDENT:  And you just — incredible job.  Incredible job., Also here with us today is Steve Ronnebeck from Mesa, Arizona.  Steve, if you could come up and share a few words, please., MR. RONNEBECK:  Thank you, Mr. President.  January 22nd, 2015, Grant was at work on his overnight shift.  An illegal alien came in wanting to buy cigarettes, dumped a jar of change out on the counter.  Grant went to count the change and wasn’t counting fast enough.  So, basically, this man pulled a gun.  Grant did everything he was supposed to do and gave him the cigarettes.  The man went ahead and executed him and shot him point blank in the face., You know, you don’t hear these stories, and some of our media won’t talk to you about it, but this is permanent separation.  For his birthday, I go to his grave.  For Christmas — we set up a Christmas tree on Grant’s grave., I received something earlier today from Director Homan; it was a challenge coin.  And I want to thank you for that.  To me this is a sign of integrity.  I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our President, our Vice President, Director Homan, all of you in law enforcement.  I wish some of our media had the same integrity.  And I want to thank all of you, especially our law enforcement, for what you do., Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, thank you.  Members of VOICE, Barbara Gonzalez, Jon Feere, AVIAC — I want to thank all of them too, because they’re helping get the stories out.  Sixty-three thousand Americans since 9/11 have been killed by illegal aliens.  This isn’t a problem that’s going away; it’s getting bigger., Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Sixty-three thousand.  And that number, they say, is very low because things aren’t reported.  Sixty-three thousand.  And you don’t hear about that., Also here with us today is Michelle Root from Modale, Iowa.  Great place.  Michelle, please come up., MS. ROOT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My daughter, Sarah Root, was killed within 24 hours after graduating with a Bachelor’s — 4.0 — in Criminal Investigations.  Out celebrating, stopped at a stoplight, and rear-ended by Edwin Mejia going 70-plus miles an hour.  He was arrested but then he paid a $5,000 bail, and now he has fled., Our separation, like everybody has said, is permanent.  Sarah never gets to go on to be a wife, a mother, a grandmother, an aunt.  My son does not have his only sibling any longer.  My life has been devastated and so has my daughter’s family and friends., I want to thank President Trump and Vice President Pence, Barbara Gonzalez, Jon Feere, and Director Homan for all their support.  They have never given up on us.  AVIAC was a group that we started because we were tired of not having anybody else to go to, to get information.  When Sarah was killed January 31st of 2016, I had nobody, but I was thankful for my politicians in my area.  And, you know, President Trump was one of the first ones to reach out to my family, and he has been there from the beginning.  He never left our side., Now we just need to get my daughter’s killer found.  Again, my separation is permanent.  Sarah is never coming home.  I never get to take a selfie with her again.  I have no more pictures of her.  So, please — thank you guys for everything.  Keep up the great work.  Our police officers, our Border Patrol, please continue to fight.  Thank you.  (Applause.), MS. MENDOZA:  Thank you.  My name is Maryann Mendoza.  And my son, Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, was killed on May 12th, 2014, on his way home from work by a three-time legal-limit drunk, who was also high on meth.  He had drove over 35 miles the wrong way on four different freeways in Phoenix before slamming head-on into my son’s car., As you know, they could fill this stage up every day for the next five months of victims of illegal alien crime, and it would just keep going.  Unfortunately, we are members of a club of our children, our loved ones who’ve been killed by illegal aliens, but there’s hundreds of thousands of victims every year who are affected by illegal alien crime — rape, assault, identity theft., These are things that go unreported, unchecked.  You know, if the public would go to IllegalAlienCrimeReport.com and see the magnitude of crimes being committed against your fellow Americans by illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country, you will be sickened, because the mainstream media does not let you know what’s really happening., And we are here — the members of AVIAC are here to educate the public as to what’s happening.  And if anybody has been a victim of illegal alien crime, contact us because we have close connections with Barbara Gonzalez at ICE and Jon Feere.  We have connections at the Department of Homeland Security that we are trying to get people the help that they need, and sent in the right direction., President Trump, Vice President Pence, you’ve just been there for us, and there are no words to describe what your support and your caring has meant to each and every one of us.  And thank you from the bottom of my heart.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, darling., Come.  Come.  Your story is incredible., MS. DURDEN:  I’m one of your legal immigrants.  I came the right way.  I paid lots of money.  It took me five years to become a citizen, a proud citizen.  And I didn’t drag my son — he named himself “German Chocolate”; he was born in Germany — I didn’t drag him over borders, through deserts.  I didn’t place him in harm’s way., I protected my child from harm, but I couldn’t do that on July 12th, 2012.  He was 30 years old.  I couldn’t protect him because an illegal alien from Guatemala, with two felonies, one deportation, two DUIs — he was protected.  Riverside, California: sanctuary.  The judge, the DA, they knew who he was.  They gave him probation after his second DUI.  Five weeks later, he killed my child., And if that wasn’t enough to deal with, this is my only child.  I have no family.  That’s it., The public needs to know, and they deserve to know, that this could happen to each one of you at any given second.  You hug your child, you send them off, no matter what age they are.  And then you get that ugly phone call that will forever change your life.  And thank God our President and Vice President, VOICE, my family at AVIAC, they rallied behind us — they were the only ones — and gave us a little light., I was going to end my life; I had no purpose.  But President Trump, coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration, stopped me in my track.  And I had no clue at that point that I would ever be at the White House.  And I thank President Trump, Vice President, everybody behind me — I thank you.  I thank everybody out here.  Make sure you get our stories out.  I brought my son.  This is what I have left — his ashes.  I wear his ashes in a locket.  This is how I get to hug my son., So remember, when you go and hug your kids, that there are many of us, thousands of us, who don’t get to do that anymore.  And let’s work together and get this done — all politicians.  I don’t care what side you’re on.  You don’t want your child in a casket or in an urn., So get it together, for God’s sake, for this country, for our citizens., Thank you.  (Applause.), MR. TRANCHANT:  My name is Ray Tranchant.  And I retired from the Navy.  I flew off of aircraft carriers and had a great Navy career.  And then I started my family in the ’90s.  I had two little girls, Tessa and Kelsey, and they had a bigger brother, Dylan.  And I raised them — and their mother and her mom is Hispanic, and so Tessa was Hispanic.  And they lived near the border, as well., Tessa was 16; she was a dreamer, and so was her friend Allie (ph) Kunhardt — 17 years old — 16 years old.  Both beautiful girls.  And they just loved talking about the future.  They went to a Wawa in Virginia Beach to get a pack of gum, and they were stopped at a stoplight, and Alfredo Ramos was driving at 70 miles an hour.  He was three times the legal limit.  He had been arrested before for DUI, in which the judge gave him no time or fines.  He had a fake ID from Florida, bought by the cartels.  He had a fake driver’s license in this car.  And he couldn’t speak English, and he needed an interpreter for the last DUI hearing.  He was also arrested for drunk in public., Bottom line: As he came in through Mesa and he tried to make it, and he was going — he was three times the legal limit.  So the police told me that, at that, it’s like wearing almost blackout glasses while you’re driving., When he hit the girls from behind, it was an explosion.  The neighborhood thought a bomb went off.  The girls were almost instantaneously dead.  They worked on Tessa for a while, and I got to see her in the hospital., Those are the dreamers that the United States should focus on.  I can’t make an opinion about the young people that are here illegally because their parents brought them.  But I can guarantee you the government had nothing to do with that.  And everybody wants to blame, but the parents of those children are to blame., And there was a lot of, “Well, maybe they’ll feel sorry for them because they’re kids.  And maybe if they behave, they’ll just magically beat the system.”  My mom came from Ireland.  It took her 10 years to get her citizenship.  She had a sponsor.  If she got in trouble, not only did she get in trouble, the sponsor was in trouble., I would have been speaking Northern Irish right now if she got out of line.  That’s the way it was with INS in those days.  And mom loved being an American.  I helped her study for her exam., So I’m all about legal immigration.  But the invaders and people who come over our borders and decide to take the law in their own hands, and maybe are supported by a group of people that, for God’s sakes, I don’t know why they would want to do it — it’s evil, it hurts people, and it costs us billions of dollars a year.  And they don’t seem to want to pay for it.  They want us to pay for it, the other taxpayers., I want to thank President Trump, because when those kids died, I was a city employee, so of course I sued the city and the judge, and the adjoining city with the judge there.  And, of course, they’re immune., But it didn’t make me really friendly with the city.  It didn’t make me friendly with ICE, because basically they claimed they weren’t called.  The sheriff’s department said that we called them, and it was a back-and-forth.  So no one took responsibility., So being in that situation, where no one takes responsibility in this government at all means that your standing in a dark forest at night when it’s raining and it’s cold and your lost, everybody you talk to, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, he was drunk and we have a lot of drunks here and blah, blah” — let me tell you, the guy shouldn’t have been there at that time.  He shouldn’t have been there.  And we had many opportunities to get him out., So what’s happening?  Our representative is the President and the Vice President.  They took us in, and we’re going to fight this battle.  And we’re going to win it.  And we’re going to clean it up.  And I’m very proud of that.  I’m very proud to be a part of that.  And I will support you, as law enforcement, and my President and Vice President as much as they need., I want to thank the Remembrance Project for standing there when I had no one else.  And God bless you, and I hope this doesn’t happen to you.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  This is Tom Selleck.  (Laughter.)  Except better looking.  Right?  Better looking., MS. GIBBONEY:  Thank you.  Thank you.  My name is Angel mom Agnes Gibboney.  My family legally emigrated from Hungary.  We escaped during the revolution.  We couldn’t come to the United States as my mother planned because my father was born in Yugoslavia and they wanted us to stay.  And because my mother said no, they didn’t allow us to come to the American embassy.  We went to — we had the choice of South Africa, Austria, or Brazil.  We went to Brazil and lived there 13 years trying to legally immigrate to the United States., When we immigrated to Brazil, we were stateless.  We didn’t belong anywhere because the government took our citizenship because we escaped.  And when we came to United States, we were stateless.  And I’m very honored and proud to say this is my home, my country.  And I will fight for this country until my death., Thank you, law enforcement, Border Patrol, immigration, Barbara, everybody that got me here today.  And thank you for fighting this fight with us.  Because trust me, you don’t want to talk in our shoes., And, President Trump, thank you for always standing behind us.  You are the biggest birthday present I got, and I’m still waiting for that shovel to help build the wall at the border.  I live in California., And I would like to ask, if you don’t want your state to become a sanctuary state — so I would like to ask President Trump, if you would tweet and endorse us to FightSanctuaryState.com to help us so we’re not going to go down.  Because if California continues on this path, the rest of the country will follow., And I am so proud and honored of you, Mr. President.  The integrity and character that you have shown us, pulling the daggers out of your back every day hasn’t been fair.  But I want you to know that I’m very honored to call you my President.  And God bless you and your family always, and Mr. Pence.  And God bless this country.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.), MR. ROSENBERG:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  This is my son, Drew.  He was in law school in San Francisco in 2010 when Roberto Galo tried to make a last-second left-hand turn and hit him.  Instead of stopping, he tried to flee.  So he accelerated, drove over his body.  My son was on a motorcycle.  His helmet came off, wedged under one of his tires.  He backed up, driving over him a second time, and then trying to get away, went forward.  By that time, a guy had gotten out of the car and stood in front of Galo.  And he stopped with his rear tire on my son’s abdomen.  And five people had to lift the car off of him., But I want to talk about somebody else.  And you heard Agnes mention FightSanctuaryState.com.  In April of this year, I filed with the state of California an initiative to overturn the sanctuary state.  There’s just way too many deaths, way too many traffic collisions., I should just add, on an aside, we gave out driver’s licenses in 2015.  And in two years — the first two years of that — traffic fatalities on what was supposed to be safer roads have gone up 19 percent.  Hit-and-runs have gone up 26 percent.  Yet, they’re still telling people the roads are safer because of that., But there’s so many other — and then, somebody who is not here, a woman named Veronica Cabrera Ramirez — to give you an example of what happens with sanctuary — she was a domestic violence victim.  Called the Santa Rosa police.  They arrested the perpetrator.  He had been deported previously.  ICE filed a detainer.  And then, the day that they decided to release him, instead of calling ICE and giving ICE a chance to show up — they were an hour and a half away — they gave them 16 minutes to show up and they released him.  And 16 days later, he murdered Ms. Ramirez., And according to Kevin de León, who was the author of the sanctuary bill, that makes the state safer — if you keep the federal police, the federal law enforcement over here, and you keep the state law enforcement here, that makes the state safer.  That’s absurd.  It’s outrageous.  And something has to be done and I hope that — as Agnes said, if we don’t kill this in California, it will spread.  And I know it already is in some places.  It’s a death sentence for American law-abiding citizens., Anyway, I’d like to thank the President and the Vice President, and everybody else who is here.  Director Homan, thank you so much.  You’ve become an incredible friend.  Jon Feere, Barbara Gonzalez, and, my new friend today, Kirstjen Nielsen.  (Laughs.)  Anyway, thank you all very much, particularly law enforcement.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  And I just said, “Would you like to speak?”  And you said, “No, I cry too…” — she said, “I’ve been crying for too long, for too much.”  So, that’s fine.  Right?, PARTICIPANT:  Yes., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s good.  Well, I just want to thank everybody for being here.  I know these families.  I know many more families that have gone through the same thing.  And I cannot imagine it being any worse, but we pledge to act with strength and with resolve, and in the memory of those who have been lost so needlessly., And it’s because of families like yours, that my administration created the new office of DHS — the Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement — which has been doing, I hear, a fantastic job.  We call it “VOICE” so that your voices can be heard., Today, we have released the first VOICE report.  Within the first months of VOICE, we’ve opened more than 2,800 victims registered to receive information on their perpetrator.  We’re following these people.  We’re following them so it can’t happen again by that individual., VOICE assisted hundreds of families already, connected them to crucial services such as grief counseling, followed up their cases, and helped ensure that the criminal aliens that harmed their families so egregiously were detained, removed, and deported., Our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the United States.  We want safety in our country.  We want border security.  We don’t want people in our country that don’t go through a process.  We want people in our country based on merit.  Not based on a draw, where other countries put their absolute worst in a bin and they start drawing people.  Do you think they’re going to put their good ones?  They don’t put their good ones.  They put their bad ones.  And then, when they commit crimes, we’re so surprised., We will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all.  We want safety in our country.  We want strong borders.  We want people to come in, but we want them to come in the proper way.  So thank you all for being here.  These are incredible families, incredible people.  Your loved ones have not died in vain.  Much of what we’re doing today is because of what you’ve had to endure., And we just thank you all very much for being here.  And God bless you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you, everybody., Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you., END, 3:15 P.M.



       "21   [Roosevelt Room, 4:19 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, everyone. Appreciate it. And good afternoon. I would like to provide an update to the American people regarding the crisis on our southern border — and crisis it is., Illegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars each year., America is a welcoming country. And under my leadership, it’s a welcoming country. We lead the world in humanitarian protection and assistance, by far. There’s nobody even close. We have the largest and most expansive immigration programs anywhere on the planet., We’ve issued 40 million green cards since 1970, which means the permanent residency and a path to citizenship for many, many people. But we will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally. We won’t allow it., Mass, uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful, law-abiding immigrants already living here who followed the rules and waited their turn. Some have been waiting for many years. Some have been waiting for a long time. They’ve done everything perfectly. And they’re going to come in. At some point, they’re going to come in. In many cases, very soon. We need them to come in, because we have companies coming into our country; they need workers. But they have to come in on a merit basis, and they will come in on a merit basis., The communities are often left to bear the cost and the influx of people that come in illegally. We can’t allow that., There’s a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies. Every day, above and beyond our existing lawful admission programs, roughly 1,500 to 2,000 people try crossing our borders illegally. We do a very good job considering the laws are so bad. They’re not archaic; they’re incompetent. It’s not that they’re old; they’re just bad. And we can’t get any Democrat votes to change them. It’s only the Republicans that are — in unison, they want to change them. They want to make strong borders, want to get rid of any crime because of the borders, of which there’s a lot., And we’ve done a great job with the laws that we have. We’re moving in tremendous numbers of people to get out the MS-13 gangs and others gangs that illegally come into our country. And we’re getting them out by the thousands., But this is a perilous situation, and it threatens to become even more hazardous as our economy gets better and better. A lot of the cause of this problem is the fact that we right now have the hottest economy anywhere in the world. It’s doing better than any economy in the world. Jobs, unemployment — you look at any number., Right now, we have more workers than any time in the history of our country. We have more people working, which is a tremendous statement. More people working than at any time in the history of our country. And people want to come in, and in some cases, they want to take advantage of that, and that’s okay. And we want them to come in, but they have to come in through merit. They have to come in legally., At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an “invasion.” It’s like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border. You saw that two days ago. These are tough people, in many cases. A lot of young men, strong men. And a lot of men that maybe we don’t want in our country. But again, we’ll find that out through the legal process., But they’ve overrun the Mexican police, and they’ve overrun and hurt badly Mexican soldiers. So this isn’t an innocent group of people. It’s a large number of people that are tough. They’ve injured, they’ve attacked, and the Mexican police and military has actually suffered. And I appreciate what Mexico is trying to do., So let me begin by stating that these illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States, and they should turn back now, because they’re wasting their time. They should apply to come into our country. We want them to come into our country very much. We need people to help us, with all of these companies that are coming in. We’ve never had anything like this. We have car companies coming in. We have Foxconn — so involved with the manufacturing of Apple products — coming in in Wisconsin. We have a lot of companies coming in, but they have to apply, and they have to be wonderful people that are going to love our country and work hard., And we’ve already dispatched, for the border, the United States military. And they will do the job. They are setting up right now, and they’re preparing. We hope nothing happens. But if it does, we are totally prepared. Greatest military anywhere in the world, and it’s going to be, and is now, in great shape. No longer depleted like it was when I took over as the President of the United States., The government of Mexico has generously offered asylum, jobs, education, and medical care for people within the caravan, but many members of the caravan have refused these offers, which demonstrate that these migrants are not legitimate asylum-seekers. They’re not looking for protection. Because if they were, they’d be able to get it from Mexico. Mexico has agreed to take them in and encouraged them to stay. But they don’t want to stay; they want to come into the United States. So this is no longer safety, and asylum is about safety., Asylum is not a program for those living in poverty. There are billions of people in the world living at the poverty level. The United States cannot possibly absorb them all. Asylum is a very special protection intended only for those fleeing government persecution based on race, religion, and other protected status., These caravans and illegal migrants are drawn to our country by Democrat-backed laws and left-wing judicial rulings. We’re getting rulings that are so ridiculous, so bad. They’re writing the laws. Can’t do that. Collectively known as — as an example, catch-and-release. It’s a disgrace that we have to put up with it., These policies lead to the release of illegal aliens into our communities after they’ve been apprehended. But we’re not releasing anymore. Big change, as of a couple of days ago. We’re going to no longer release. We’re going to catch; we’re not going to release. They’re going to stay with us until the deportation hearing or the asylum hearing takes place. So we’re not releasing them into the community., We have millions of people that, over the years, have been released into the community. They never show up for the trials. They never come back. They’re never seen again. And those people, they know who they are. And we know a lot of where they are, who they are. And those people will be deported, directly deported., The biggest loophole drawing illegal aliens to our borders is the use of fraudulent or meritless asylum claims to gain entry into our great country. An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds a Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language — by lawyers and others that stand there trying to get fees or whatever they can get — they’re given a phrase to read. They never heard of the phrase before. They don’t believe in the phrase. But they’re given a little legal statement to read, and they read it. And now, all of a sudden, they’re supposed to qualify. But that’s not the reason they’re here., This merely asserts the need for asylum, and then often released into the United States, and they await a lengthy court process. The court process will takes years sometimes for them to attend. Well, we’re not releasing them into our country any longer. They’ll wait for long periods of time. We’re putting up massive cities of tents. The military is helping us incredibly well., I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They’ve been so efficient, so good, so talented. And we have thousands of tents. We have a lot of tents; we have a lot of everything. We’re going to hold them right there. We’re not letting them into our country. And then they never show up — almost. It’s like a level of 3 percent. They never show up for the trial. So by the time their trial comes, they’re gone. Nobody knows where they are. But we know where a lot of them are, and they’re going to be deported., There are now nearly 700,000 aliens inside the United States awaiting adjudication of their claims. Most of these people we have no idea how they got there, why they got there. And the number is actually going to be a much larger number as we look at all of the data. So if you look at just at a minimal number, it’s the size of Vermont, or bigger. And the overall number could be 10 million people; it could be 12 million people; it could be 20 million people. The record keeping from past administrations has not exactly been very good., As human smugglers and traffickers have learned how the game is played and how to game the system, we have witnessed a staggering 1,700 [percent] increase in asylum claims since the year 2010. They understand the law better than the lawyers understand the law. You have a lot of professionalism there. You have a lot of professionalism involved with setting up the caravans. You take a look at the way that’s happening. Even the countries — you look at Honduras and El Salvador, and you look at what’s happening at the different levels and different countries, and what’s happening on the streets. There’s a lot of professionalism taking place, and there seems to be a lot of money passing. And then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, these big caravans are formed and they start marching up. They got a long way to go., On average, once released, an asylum case takes three and half years to complete. Think of it. Somebody walks into our country, reads a statement given by a lawyer, and we have a three-and-a-half-year court case for one person, whereas other people tell them, “Out. Get out. Just get out.” Other countries — “Get out. We have a border. Get out.”, We go through years and years of litigation because of the Democrats and the incompetent, very, very stupid laws that we have. They’re the laughingstock all over the world, including the people that are marching up. They understand. But the difference is, we’re not allowing them in, and we’re not releasing, and we’re not doing any of the things that were done for so many years that really are terrible for our country., The overwhelming majority of claims are rejected by the courts, but by that time, the alien has usually long since disappeared into our country. So they never get to see the judge. They never get to have a ruling. They don’t care because they’re in the country and nobody knows where they are., All told, there are approximately 1 million aliens who have received final orders of removal. They’ve actually got final orders of removal. You don’t have to go to court anymore. The courts have already issued the orders of removal, and we’ve gotten a lot of them. But who remain at large in our country. So we’ve moving them out., This endemic abuse of the asylum system makes a mockery of our immigration system, displacing legitimate asylum-seekers — and there are legitimate asylum-seekers — while rewarding those who abuse or defraud our system, which is almost everybody. Everybody is abusing it and just doing things to our system which were unthinkable, I’m sure even by the Democrats who were largely responsible for getting it done., These individuals disrespect the foundations of American government by voluntarily choosing to break the law as their first act on American soil., Furthermore, contained within this giant flow of illegal migration to our southwest border is the movement of illicit and deadly narcotics. It’s in the southwest, most of it comes in. Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through the southern border– think of that: 100 percent, almost, of heroin comes in through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, and the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of the ultra-lethal fentanyl killing our youth. Fentanyl is killing our youth., These drugs destroy the lives and kill much more than 70,000 Americans every single year. And the number goes up. It goes up and up and up, because we are so foolish with our laws that we allow this to happen. A death toll equivalent of the size of an entire American city every year., \\nThe current influx, if not halted, threatens to overwhelm our immigration system and our communities, and poses unacceptable dangers to the entire nation. We have to have our borders. Can’t let drugs come in. Not just — it’s not just people. It’s people; it’s drugs. It’s human traffickers., Human trafficking is now at the highest level in the world that it’s ever been. And that’s because of the Internet. Think of it — human trafficking. You think back 200 years, 500 years. Human trafficking — where they steal children; in many cases, women, unfortunately. They steal women. The human traffickers, the lowest scum on Earth. The lowest scum on Earth. And it’s at a level that it’s never been. Worldwide — never been at a level like this., If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow. And you see that’s what’s happening now. We have one that’s coming up, and it’s being somewhat dissipated, as they march. But then other people are joining it. And then it gets bigger. And now, if you look back at Honduras, and if you look at El Salvador, other ones are solving and they’re forming. They’re forming. You have new ones that are forming. And we call it “caravan number two” is unbelievably rough people. Very, very hard for the military to stop it. Our military will have no problem. But very, very hard. Mexico is having a very, very hard time with it., Once they arrive, the Democrat Party’s vision is to offer them free healthcare, free welfare, free education, and even the right to vote. You and the hardworking taxpayers of our country will be asked to pick up the entire tab. And that’s what’s happening — medical and, in many cases, they’ve got some big medical problems before they get here., No nation can allow itself to be overwhelmed by uncontrolled masses of people rushing their border. That’s what’s happening. They are rushing our border. They are coming up. And even before you get to the caravan, just on a daily basis, people coming in. And it’s a very bad thing for our country. It’s sad in many ways, but it’s a very bad thing for our country. And again, costs us billions and billions and billions of dollars a year., And I will therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this crisis. And that’s what we’re doing. The United States military, great people., My administration is finalizing a plan to end the rampant abuse of our asylum system — it’s abused — to halt the dangerous influx, and to establish control over America’s sovereign borders. We got borders. And once that control is set and standardized, and made very strong — including the building of the wall, which we’ve already started. $1.6 billion spent last year; $1.6 billion this year. We have another $1.6 [billion] that will be coming, but we want to build it at one time. All it does is turn people in a different direction if you don’t. We want to build it at one time., Under this plan, the illegal aliens will no longer get a free pass into our country by lodging meritless claims in seeking asylum. Instead, migrants seeking asylum will have to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. So they’re going to have to lawfully present themselves at a port of entry. Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country. We will hold them — for a long time, if necessary., The only long-term solution to the crisis, and the only way to ensure the endurance of our nation as a sovereign country, is for Congress to overcome open borders obstruction. That’s exactly what it is: It’s open border obstruction. No votes. You can come up with the greatest border plan, the greatest immigration plan. You won’t get one vote from a Democrat. They have terrible policy. In many cases, they’re terrible politicians. But the one thing I give them great credit for: They vote as a bloc. They stick together., And we will end catch-and-release. We’re not releasing any longer. We also must finish the job that we started by being strong at the border. When we’re strong at the border, people will turn away and they won’t bother. You will see, in a year from now, or in certainly a period of time from now, despite our very good economy, which some of them come for that — I can’t blame them for that; you have to do it legally — but you will see that the numbers of people trying to get in will be greatly reduced., But that can only happen if we’re strong at the border. And the southern border is a big problem, and it’s a tremendous problem for drugs pouring in and destroying our youth, and, really, destroying the fabric of our country. There’s never been a drug problem like we have today. And as I said, much of it comes from the southern border., So in the meantime, I will fulfill my sacred obligation to protect our country and defend the United States of America. And this is a defense of our country. We have no choice. We have no choice. We will defend our borders, we will defend our country., Thank you very much., Q Mr. President, what happens to the children then? If you’re ending catch-and-release, what happens to those children? Do they stay in these tent cities? Or what happens?, THE PRESIDENT: We’re working on a system where they stay together. But I will say that, by doing that, tremendous numbers — you know, under the Obama plan, you could separate children. They never did anything about that. Nobody talks about that. But under President Obama, they separated children from the parents. We actually put it so that that didn’t happen., But what happens when you do that is you get tremendous numbers of people coming. It’s almost like an incentive to — when they hear they’re not going to be separated, they come many, many times over. But President Obama separated the children, the parents. And nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, this country went crazy., So we are going to continue and try to continue what we’re doing. But it is a tremendous incentive for people to try. But it’s going to be very, very hard for people to come into our country. So we think we’ll be able to do that., Q With the military, do you envision them firing upon any of these people?, THE PRESIDENT: I hope not., Q Could you see the military (inaudible)?, THE PRESIDENT: I hope not. It’s the military — I hope — I hope there won’t be that. But I will tell you this: Anybody throwing stones, rocks — like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico — we will consider that a firearm. Because there’s not much difference, where you get hit in the face with a rock — which, as you know, it was very violent a few days ago — very, very violent — that break-in. It was a break-in of a country. They broke into Mexico., And you look at what’s happening in Guatemala, just to mention Guatemala, along with El Salvador and Honduras. It’s disgraceful that those countries aren’t able to stop this. Because they should be able to stop it before it starts., And the United States pays them a fortune, and we’re looking at not doing that anymore. Because why should we be doing that when they do nothing for us?, Jeff. Jeff, go ahead., Q Mr. President, how is this plan going to be legal, considering the current law?, THE PRESIDENT: Oh, this is totally legal. No. This is legal. We are stopping people at the border. This is an invasion, and nobody is even questioning that., Q But in terms of your plans to change asylum, are you going to do this via executive order?, THE PRESIDENT: No, no, you don’t have to — you don’t have to release. You have — you can hold. The problem is, to hold people, you need massive facilities. It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Another country says, “Sorry, you can’t come in.” With us, we take their name, take their phone number, take their everything, and say, “Good luck.” Only because we don’t have the facilities to hold people. But we’re building the facilities now. We’re building massive numbers of tents, and we will hold them in tents. But you don’t have to release them. They released them only because they didn’t have the facilities to hold them., Q Mr. President, is there like an executive order that you’re going to be releasing today?, THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we will be doing an executive order sometime next week, yes., Q (Inaudible) executive order dealing with ending catch-and-release and asylum?, THE PRESIDENT: It’s going to end — it’s going to be talking about everything. It’ll be quite comprehensive. Many of the things we’ve talked about today., Q Mr. President, so you’re — so just to clarify, you are speaking of, in the tents, these family units that would arrive (inaudible) the children?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have other facilities also. But what’s happened is we are holding so many facilities — so many people that our facilities are being overrun. They’re being overrun. And we are putting up temporary facilities. Eventually, people won’t be coming here anymore when they realize they can’t get through., Q So they will hold the children in those tents with their parents?, THE PRESIDENT: We will be holding the family and the children together. Remember this: President Obama separated children from families. And all I did was take the same law, and then I softened the law. But by softening the law, many people come up that would not have come up if there was separation., Q Mr. President, what do you say to the critics who think this is a political thing before the midterms?, THE PRESIDENT: There’s nothing political about a caravan of thousands of people, and now others forming, pouring up into our country. We have no idea who they are. All we know is they’re pretty tough people when they can blast through the Mexican military and Mexican police. They’re pretty tough people. Even Mexico said, “Wow, these are tough people.” I don’t want them in our country. And women don’t want them in our country. Women want security. Men don’t want them in our country. But the women do not want them. Women want security. You look at what the women are looking for. They want to have security. They don’t want to have these people in our country. And they’re not going to be in our country. It’s a very big thing., Yes., Q Mr. President, when you talk about finalizing a plan to end asylum, is this a plan that would be included in that executive order?, THE PRESIDENT: Oh, no, people are going to have a chance to go for asylum. But if you look at the records, not very many people are allowed to stay once they go to court. But what happens is they’d go into — they were using asylum — first of all, they were told what to say by lawyers and others. “Read this statement.” You read the statement, and now you’re seeking asylum. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we won’t put up with it any longer., Q President Trump, U.S. law and international law says that people who have valid claims have a right to seek asylum., THE PRESIDENT: That’s right., Q So why would — why would they be —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re going to go to court. They’re going to go to court, as crazy as it sounds. They’re going to go —, Q But the law say that they don’t — they’re not —, THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. Excuse me. Ready? They’re going to go to court, and a judge is going to determine. But usually, when they go to court, they’re deported. It just seems that most of the people are deported once they go. The problem is they never end up going to court, because when they come in, they’re told to come back in a year, for a court case, and they disappear into the United States never to be seen again., But we’re going to be —, Q But the current laws doesn’t say about holding people in tent cities., THE PRESIDENT: And they’re given deportation notices. We will be deporting those people., Q Mr. President, you’re saying rocks are — rock-throwing, like happened in Mexico, will be considered —, THE PRESIDENT: We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they’re throwing rocks viciously and violently. You saw that three days ago. Really hurting the military. We’re not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We’re going to consider — and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle., Jeff?, Q A separate topic, sir. Did you offer Heather Nauert the job of U.N. Ambassador?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, she’s under very serious consideration. She’s excellent. She’s been with us a long time. She’s been a supporter for a long time. And she’s really excellent. So she’s under very serious — we’ll probably make a decision next week. We have a lot of people that want the job, and there are a lot of really great people. But we’ll be talking about that next week sometime., Q Did you see Oprah Winfrey’s comments today?, THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t. What did she say?, Q She was campaigning in Georgia at the same time that Vice President Pence was., THE PRESIDENT: At the same time as who?, Q Excuse me, at the same time Vice President Pence was, encouraging people to vote and —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s okay. I mean, I was on Oprah’s last week — the last week of her show. Oprah liked me very much. I’ve always liked Oprah. You know, Oprah is good. But the woman that she’s supporting is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia, by any stretch of the imagination., And I’ll be in Georgia the next few days — the next few days — and we have a tremendous — around Macon — we have a tremendous crowd already. Nobody has a crowd like we have because people want to see a great governor of Georgia. And I think Brian is going to be a great governor of Georgia. I think he’ll be a fantastic governor. He’s totally qualified., She is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia. She’s not qualified. And Georgia is a great state —, Q Why is she not qualified?, THE PRESIDENT: — it’s a great, great state. Take a — take a look. Take a look at her past. Take a look at her history. Take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state. That state will be in big, big trouble very quickly. And the people of Georgia don’t want that., Question?, ...]

       "22   [U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement Headquarters, Washington, D.C., 11:58 A.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Secretary Nielsen, Acting Director Vitiello, and to all of the courageous Americans who every day are “protecting national security and upholding public safety,” it is my great honor — at a critical time in the life of this agency — to address the dedicated men and women of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Thank you.  (Applause.), And I bring greetings this morning from a great champion of law and order.  And as he reminded and wanted me to convey today, a leader who stands without apology with the men and women of ICE and law enforcement at every level.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), Just this week, President Trump said that the men and women of ICE are, in his words, “incredible people,” and I know that to be true — “incredible patriots.”  The President sent me here today with a very simple message: While I stand before you today at time when some people are actually calling for the abolition of ICE, in this White House, let me be clear: We are with you 100 percent.  And as the President said last night, “We will always stand proudly with the brave heroes of ICE and our Border Patrol.”  (Applause.)  We will., Now before I go further, let me give thanks to a few other great leaders.  First and foremost, I want to thank Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.  Not just for the warm introduction, but more importantly for her strong and resolute leadership of our Department of Homeland Security.  She has stood strong for the courageous men and women of this agency; and the American people and our safety have been advanced as a result.  Would you join me in thanking the Sixth Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, for your service to the United States.  (Applause.), Let me also take a moment to recognize a new leader of this agency, as of Monday of this week.  But a man who has spent more than 33 years enforcing and upholding our laws, defending our borders, and seeing to the law and order, and the protection of the American people.  Join me in thanking Acting Director Ronald Vitiello for a career of service and for stepping up to serve our nation at such a time as this.  (Applause.), And finally, let me just say thank you to all of you — all of you who are here today and all of you who are watching all across this nation at the more than 400 offices of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.  You’re on the frontlines of enforcing America’s laws and ensuring our — the vitality of this nation and the security of our people.  And you have our thanks; the thanks of our President; and, I want to assure you, you have the thanks and the admiration of the American people., It’s been true ever since this agency was founded more than 15 years ago.  Over the years, I’ve had the privilege to meet countless ICE agents and Border Patrols officers.  I was recently with the Secretary at El Centro Station, Imperial Valley, California, and I never failed to be inspired when I’m around men and women who have answered a call to uphold the laws of this nation throughout this great and storied agency., The truth is, your courage, your determination, your dedication to the law and to the American people inspires me and inspires the people of this country.  At this agency, as the Secretary just described, more than 20,000 patriots stand every day — investigators, field officers, special agents, analysists — each and every day stand for the rule of law in this nation and stand for the interests of the American people.  You step up to enforce our system of legal immigration., And the truth is, every day — every day, men and women of ICE also confront criminal illegal immigrants who endanger our communities and prey on our most vulnerable.  Our ICE agents are busy every day taking them off the streets.  You’ve fought vicious gangs like MS-13.  You’ve stopped human smugglers, child traffickers, and destructive drug cartels that are poisoning our youth and stealing lives of promise.  You’ve apprehended terrorists who’ve come into our country to challenge our way of life and harm our people., The truth is, the statistics really don’t tell the tale, but they’re worth repeating.  In 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made 4,818 gang arrests, including — they took from the streets — 796 members of the MS-13 gangs.  And our communities are safer as a result.  (Applause.), There were nearly 33,000 arrests by ICE personnel — criminal arrests, individuals who came into this country illegally and then pursued crime against our people.  Nearly a million pounds of narcotics were seized by ICE agents in 2017 alone.  And most touchingly to me, as a father, ICE agents rescued 518 human trafficking victims, and 904 children subject to child exploitation were rescued by ICE agents all across America.  We are enforcing our laws and protecting the most vulnerable.  (Applause.), You do all this because you love your country.  You do all this because you’re called to serve.  But I want you to know, President Trump and I and the American people understand that, behind these statistics, in this work you also — you do so oftentimes without regard to your personal safety.  Men and women of ICE, like all of law enforcement, you’ve answered a call that requires you to put the lives of your countrymen ahead of your own.  And I want you and your loved ones to know that we understand this.  We appreciate and understand the risks that you face when you come into contact with violent criminals, when you enforce the law, when you remove drug dealers and gang members from our streets that threaten our families., In recent years, tragically, attacks on you and your fellow law enforcement officers have risen dramatically.  In 2017, attacks on your fellow DHS colleagues at Customs and Border Protection increased by nearly 75 percent.  And at ICE, assaults on your officers nearly tripled in 2017., But remarkably, but not surprisingly, these attacks have not diminished your commitment, or your courage, or your determination to enforce our laws.  I see it in your faces as I’m addressing you today, and I see it every time that I’m with ICE and Border Patrol personnel.  The challenges only steel the resolve of courageous men and women who have the character to serve.  And I want to assure you, these challenges and the challenges you face have only strengthened the resolve of this President and this administration to stand with you every step of the way.  (Applause.), I want to assure you, as I travel across this country, that the American people know that men and women of ICE are American heroes, that you’re doing an important job.  You’re often doing a dangerous job, and you’re doing it for them.  And I want to promise you that we’re going to continue to work to make sure that this agency has both the support, the respect, and the resources that you deserve to do the job that you have been called to do.  The American people support you because they know how important your mission is., But as we all have seen in the press lately, the heroes of ICE are being attacked and demonized for the work that you do in an unprecedented rate in recent weeks.  ICE has been targeted with protests across this country, not only on the job but in public square and social media, and for many of you, even at your homes.  The hashtag, ”#AbolishICE,” has now taken its place on the Internet.  Protestors chant, “No ban, no wall, no borders at all” at protests around the country.  ICE officers and leadership have had their personal information exposed on social media, and threats to their families have followed this.  Now let me be very clear on this point: The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protest, but these threats against ICE officers and their families must stop and they must stop now.  (Applause.), The sad fact is, though, it isn’t just the expression of the radical left that’s been speaking out against ICE lately.  The truth is that opposition of ICE has moved to the center of the Democratic Party itself., Just when you thought the Democrats couldn’t move farther to the left, leading members of the Democratic Party, including candidates for higher office, are actually openly advocating for the abolition of ICE, an agency that protects the American people and our communities every single day., Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and the Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio have all already called for ICE’s abolition.  A leading candidate for governor of New York actually even appallingly called this agency a “terrorist organization.”  Now let me be clear on this point: The American people have a right to their opinions, but these spurious attacks on ICE by our political leaders must stop.  (Applause.), The type of language that’s being used to describe the men and women of this agency and the work that you do every day is unacceptable.  But you know, it’s not just me saying it.  Despite these calls from top Democrats, even today, the liberal editorial page of the Washington Post had a lead editorial entitled; ICE is “the Wrong Target for Outrage.”  In their editorial, and I quote, the Washington Post acknowledged that the “20,000 employees,” of ICE, “manage more than deportations,” they wrote.  “Its investigative division handles cybercrime; human trafficking; narcotics; counter-proliferation involving nuclear materials [and] other military wares; child exploitation…”  They went on to say, and I quote, in the Washington Post, “Those are all vital and legitimate functions of government, as is deportation. They aren’t going to be abolished, nor should they be.”  (Applause.), You know, the truth is that calls to abolish ICE are not just outrageous.  They’re irresponsible.  Abolishing ICE would mean more illegal immigration, people being able to come into our country.  Last year, ICE actually removed 226,000 illegal immigrants from our communities and our country.  Abolishing ICE would mean more violent crime.  Last year, ICE arrested more than 127,000 immigrants with criminal convictions who are facing charges for breaking our nation’s laws, including criminals who were responsible for 50,000 assault offenses and more than 11,000 weapons offenses, 2,000 kidnapping offenses, and 1,800 homicide offenses., Abolishing ICE would mean more vicious gangs like MS-13.  Now, I’ve already discussed with you the extraordinary progress in the last year that we’ve made removing dangerous MS-13 gang members from our streets.  The truth is that the arrests that were made by ICE represented an 83 percent increase from the last full year over of a previous administration.  That is real progress that’s making a difference for the safety and security of our families and our communities., Abolishing ICE also would mean more drugs in our schools and on our streets.  Last year, ICE has seized nearly 500 tons of narcotics, nearly a million pounds of heroin, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs that criminals and cartels were smuggling into our country.  Abolishing ICE also would mean more human trafficking.  And as I mentioned, last year, 518 human trafficking victims, nearly 1,000 victims of child exploitation., Abolishing ICE also would give terrorists a new chance to exploit immigration loopholes.  That’s exactly what happened before September 11, 2001.  And because of the tireless work of ICE and the entire law enforcement community over the past 15 years, I truly do believe the men and women of this agency over the last 15 years have played a critical role in ensuring that no major terrorist attack occurred on our shores.  And you deserve to be credited.  (Applause.), The record speaks for itself.  And it’s a record of accomplishment and security.  Every day, ICE makes America safer and more secure.  And every citizen of this nation is better off and safer because of the work that you do.  And so today, I want to make it clear to all of you and all of those looking on: Under President Donald Trump, we will never abolish ICE.  (Applause.)  And as the President said, we will never fail to applaud, and expand, and empower this agency with the resources that you deserve., As the President said recently, “We’re not abandoning ICE.”  In fact, it’s just the opposite.  Working with our Republican majorities in the Congress, I’m proud to report President Trump has already given this agency new funding to achieve your mission.  This year we increased your baseline budget to $7 billion; a 10-percent increase over 2017.  And the President’s called on the Congress to give additional resources of more than a billion dollars for 2019, including the hiring of 10,000 new ICE officers and investigators.  Our word to all the courageous men and women is: Help is on the way.  We’re going to make sure you have the resources and the support that you deserve.  (Applause.), And just as important, in this White House, as you all know, we’re fighting to secure our borders so that illegal immigrants, gang members, and dangerous criminals can’t enter our country in the first place., The President has already signed into law the largest investment in border security in nearly a decade, and we’ve started to build the first 100 miles of the new border wall., We’ll continue to call on the Congress — call on the Congress to come together around immigration reforms that secure our border, build a wall, close the loopholes that too often serve as a magnet for vulnerable families or worse to come in across our border., Just be confident of this, President Donald Trump and I will always fight for you.  We’ll always stand with you because we know that you are in the fight every day for the safety and security of the American people.  We’ll always have your back, but I’m here, as your Vice President, to assure you that the American people are with you., As I travel across this country, I hear the admiration and appreciation that millions of Americans have for the men and women of this agency, for the sacrifices that you and your families make every day so that their families can be safe and secure., We’re all grateful for your courage.  We’re grateful for the risk that that you’re willing to take to uphold our laws and defend our country.  We’re frankly grateful that our nation has men and women of such character and selflessness who are willing to step forward in this cause., So men and women of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, I’m here to tell you that we stand with you and we always will.  But not only will we stand with you, giving you the resources and the respect that you deserve, but I also want to assure you that you’re in our prayers.  And I know you’re in the prayers of tens of millions of Americans who understand the risk that you take — who understand that, for many of you, when you walk out the door in the morning, it’s different — like it is for every law enforcement officer in this country., You’ve responded to no ordinary calling.  It’s a calling where you’ve decided to consider others as more important than yourself.  And your families have supported you in this calling.  And we understand that., And so you go with our support, but you do — you go with our prayers.  And for my part, I can’t help but reflect on the words of the Psalmist in my hope that you would be confident that “His faithfulness will be your shield and your rampart.”  That “you will not fear the terror of night or the arrow that flies by day,” that — as you make Him your refuge.  “No harm will overtake you,” ever.  That will be our prayer., So thank you for the honor of addressing you today.  More importantly, thank you for your service.  Thank you for what you do for the American people every day to ensure the success of this nation and the security of our people., I leave here today with renewed confidence that you’ll continue to do just that.  That despite the criticism that may be leveled by some, that I know you’ll continue to do your job with determination.  You’ll uphold the rule of law.  You’ll see to the interests of the American people., And with your continued service and courage, with the support of the American people, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I know we will make America safe again.  And we’ll have all of you to thank., Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  God bless you.  God bless U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement.  And God bless the United States.  (Applause.), END, 12:21 P.M.

       "23   [Rose Garden, \\n2:35 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Please.  Thank you.  Thank you very much., We’re here on this very beautiful spring day in the Rose Garden to unveil our plan to create a fair, modern, and lawful system of immigration for the United States.  And it’s about time.  (Applause.), If adopted, our plan will transform America’s immigration system into the pride of our nation and the envy of the modern world.  Our proposal builds upon our nation’s rich history of immigration, while strengthening the bonds of citizenship that bind us together as a national family., Throughout our history, we have proudly welcomed newcomers to our shores.  Out of many people, from many places, we have forged one people and one nation under God, and we’re very proud of it.  (Applause.)  We share the same home, we share the same destiny, and we pledge allegiance to the same, great American flag.  (Applause.), Our policies have turbo-charged our economy.  Now, we must implement an immigration system that will allow our citizens to prosper for generations to come., Today, we are presenting a clear contrast: Democrats are proposing open borders, lower wages, and, frankly, lawless chaos.  We are proposing an immigration plan that puts the jobs, wages, and safety of American workers first.  (Applause.), Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker.  It’s just common sense.  It will help all of our people, including millions of devoted immigrants, to achieve the American Dream., We are grateful to be joined this afternoon by a tremendous number of people from the House, the Senate, and my Cabinet.  And I love you all, but I won’t introduce you all because I’ll be here all day long.  (Laughter.)  But you’re all here., Our plan achieves two critical goals.  First, it stops illegal immigration and fully secures the border.  And, second, it establishes a new legal immigration system that protects American wages, promotes American values, and attracts the best and brightest from all around the world., The proposal begins with the most complete and effective border security package ever assembled by our country — or any other country, for that matter.  (Applause.)  It’s so important., This plan was not developed, I’m sorry to say, by politicians.  We have a lot of politicians.  But you respect the people and you know the people that have developed this plan.  It was designed with significant input from our great law enforcement professionals to detail what they need to make our border — which is 100 percent operationally secure.  One hundred percent., Everyone agrees that the physical infrastructure on the border and the ports of entry is gravely underfunded and woefully inadequate.  We scan only a small fraction of the vehicles, goods, and all of the other things coming across, including people.  And, sadly, the drugs pour across our border.  We’re going to stop it., Investment in technology will ensure we can scan 100 percent of everything coming through, curbing the flow of drugs and contraband, while speeding up legal trade and commerce.  It’s the most heavily traded — monetarily — border anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close., To make certain that we are constantly making the upgrades we need, our proposal creates a permanent and self-sustaining border security trust fund.  This will be financed by the fees and revenues generated at the border crossings itself., Importantly, we’re already building the wall, and we should have close to 400 miles built by the end of next year, and probably even more than that.  It’s going up very rapidly.  (Applause.), And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.  They’re doing a fantastic job on the wall.  And that’s a wall that is desperately needed., As we close the gaps in our physical framework, we must also close the gaps in our legal framework.  Critical to ending the border crisis is removing all incentives for smuggling women and children.  Current law — (applause).  That’s right.  That’s right.  Women and children.  People have no idea how bad it is unless you’re there, and unless you are a member of law enforcement.  They see it every day, and they can’t believe what they see., Current law and federal court rulings encourage criminal organizations to smuggle children across the border.  The tragic result is that 65 percent of all border-crossers this year were either minors or adults traveling with minors.  Our plan will change the law to stop the flood of child smuggling and to humanely reunite unaccompanied children with their families back home — and rapidly.  As soon as possible.  (Applause.), We must also restore the integrity of our broken asylum system.  Our nation has a proud history of affording protection to those fleeing government persecutions.  Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being displaced by those lodging frivolous claims — these are frivolous claims — to gain admission into our country., Asylum abuse also strains our public school systems, our hospitals, and local shelters, using funds that we should, and that have to, go to elderly veterans, at-risk youth, Americans in poverty, and those in genuine need of protection.  We’re using the funds that should be going to them.  And that shouldn’t happen.  And it’s not going to happen in a very short period of time.  Have to get this approved., My plan expedites relief for legitimate asylum seekers by screening out the meritless claims.  If you have a proper claim, you will quickly be admitted; if you don’t, you will promptly be returned home., Crucially — (applause) — our plan closes loopholes in federal law to make clear that gang members and criminals are inadmissible.  These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world — MS-13 and others.  Inadmissible.  Not coming in.  We’re taking them out all the time by the thousands, a year, but they come in.  They are no longer admissible.  And for criminals already here, we will ensure their swift deportation.  (Applause.), We will keep our communities safe.  Americans can have complete and total confidence that under this plan, the borders will finally be fully and totally secured.  (Applause.), And I know a number of our Republican friends and others — Lindsey, I see you sitting right there, and Steve, you’re working on a plan — an immediate plan.  A smaller plan, but a very immediate plan to stop it as of this afternoon.  So, as fast as you can get something done.  This is the big, beautiful, bold plan, but we need something very quickly.  And if you can get it done, that would be fantastic.  Okay?  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Appreciate you working on it., A topic of less discussion in national media, but of vital importance to our country, is our legal immigration system itself.  Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process.  It is totally dysfunctional.  The system will finally be fair, transparent, and promote equality and opportunity for all., Every year, we admit 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents.  These green card holders get lifetime authorization to live and work here and a five-year path to American citizenship.  This is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world, by far., Currently, 66 percent of legal immigrants come here on the basis of random chance.  They’re admitted solely because they have a relative in the United States.  And it doesn’t really matter who that relative is.  Another 21 percent of immigrants are issued either by random lottery, or because they are fortunate enough to be selected for humanitarian relief., Random selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute.  While countless — and you wouldn’t believe how many countries, like Canada, create a clear path for top talent.  America does not., Under the senseless rules of the current system, we’re not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world — anybody.  We’re not able to take care of it.  We’re not able to make those incredible breakthroughs.  If somebody graduates top of their class from the best college, sorry, go back to your country.  We want to keep them here., Companies are moving offices to other countries because our immigration rules prevent them from retaining highly skilled and even, if I might, totally brilliant people.  We discriminate against genius.  We discriminate against brilliance.  We won’t anymore, once we get this passed.  And we hope to get it passed as soon as possible.  (Applause.), Some of the most skilled students at our world-class universities are going back home because they have no relatives to sponsor them here in the United States.  And that’s the only way.  We want these exceptional students and workers to stay, and flourish, and thrive in America.  (Applause.)  Thank you., As a result of our broken rules, the annual green card flow is mostly low-wage and low-skilled.  Newcomers compete for jobs against the most vulnerable Americans and put pressure on our social safety net and generous welfare programs., Only 12 percent of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit.  In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand — and others — that number is closer to 60 and even 70 and 75 percent, in some cases., The biggest change we make is to increase the proportion of highly skilled immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, and we’d like to even see if we can go higher.  (Applause.)  This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive., At the same time, we prioritize the immediate family of new Americans — spouses and children.  The loved ones you choose to build a life with, we prioritize.  And we have to do that.  They go right to the front of the line.  Right to the front of the line, where they should be.  (Applause.), America’s last major overhaul of our legal admissions policy was 54 years ago.  Think of that.  So a major update — and that’s what this is: merit system and a heart system — is long overdue., The millions of legal immigrants who have come to America over the past half century are now cherished members of our national family.  Going forward — (applause) — it is their interest, and in their interest, and their children’s interest, to adopt a green card system that promotes a rising standard of living for all of our citizens., Three in four new jobs at the end of last year went to Americans previously out of the workforce.  Our economy is better probably than it ever has been in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  And because of that great economy, we’re able to do things that nobody ever thought possible before, and that’s what we’re going to do for immigration, finally., Wages are rising but our current immigration system works at cross-purposes, placing downward pressure on wages for the working class, which is what we don’t want to do., Last year, we also passed historic criminal justice reform.  (Applause.)  And we had tremendous backing — bipartisan — from Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals.  I guess we could also use the word “progressives.”  A new word that’s come about., Americans with criminal records are getting a second chance at life in higher numbers than ever before.  Unfortunately, the current immigration rules allow foreign workers to substitute for Americans seeking entry-level jobs.  So, foreign workers are coming in and they’re taking the jobs that would normally go to American workers., America’s immigration system should bring in people who will expand opportunity for striving, low-income Americans, not to compete with those low-income Americans.  (Applause.), Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today, while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow.  And we want immigrants coming in.  We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country, but a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill.  (Applause.), The White House plan makes no change to the number of green cards allocated each year.  But instead of admitting people through random chance, we will establish simple, universal criteria for admission to the United States.  No matter where in the world you’re born, no matter who your relatives are, if you want to become an American citizen, it will be clear exactly what standard we ask you to achieve.  It will be made crystal clear.  (Applause.), This will increase the diversity of immigration flows into our country.  We will replace the existing green card categories with a new visa, the Build America visa — which is what we all want to hear.  (Applause.), Like Canada and so many other modern countries, we create an easy-to-navigate points-based selection system.  You will get more points for being a younger worker, meaning you will contribute more to our social safety net.  You will get more points for having a valuable skill, an offer of employment, an advanced education, or a plan to create jobs., We lose people that want to start companies, and, in many cases, they’re forced to leave our country; go back, usually, to the country where they came from; and they’ll start up companies, and some of those companies are among the biggest and most successful companies today in the world.  They could’ve started them right here in the United States, where they wanted to do it in the first place.  Now they’ll have a chance.  (Applause.), Priority will also be given to higher-wage workers, ensuring we never undercut American labor.  To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient., Finally, to promote integration, assimilation, and national unity, future immigrants will be required to learn English and to pass a civics exam prior to admission.  (Applause.), Through these steps, we will deliver an immigration system that respects, and even strengthens, our culture, our traditions, and our values., Four months ago, I had the honor of participating in a swearing-in ceremony for new Americans, right here in the Oval Office.  It was a beautiful reminder that American citizenship is the most precious gift our nation has to offer.  When we swear in new citizens, we do more than give them a permit; we give them a history, a heritage, a home, and a future of limitless possibilities and potential., Our nation used to pride ourselves on this capacity: our unique ability to instill the spirit of America into any human heart, into any human being.  Many of the Democrats have claimed to be for these concepts at different times in their careers and, in many cases, in very recent history.  And I hope that they will end up joining me and all of the people gathered together today in putting politics aside, putting security and wages first, and pursuing these historic reforms.  It’s time.  (Applause.), And if for some reason — possibly political — we can’t get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much., But wouldn’t it be nice to do it sooner than that?  (Laughter.)  But it’s not a very long time, is it?  Sixteen months., One of the reasons we will win is because of our strong, fair, and pro-America immigration policy.  It’s time to restore our national unity and reaffirm our national purpose.  It is time to rebuild our country for all Americans., Together, we will create an immigration system to make America safer, and stronger, and greater than ever before., Thank you.  God bless you all.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you., END, 2:59 P.M.

       "24   [Cabinet Room, 11:44 A.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  I’ll be leaving for Minnesota today.  We have two stops; one a very big one, and it will be a lot of fun.  I know a lot of you are going with us, so that will be interesting., We’re meeting right now on immigration.  And we are very strong at the border, we’re very strong on security.  We want security for our country.  The Republicans want security and insist on security for our country, and we will have that.  At the same time, we have compassion.  We want to keep families together; it’s very important.  I’ll be signing something in a little while that’s going to do that.  And the people in this room want to do that, and they’re working on various pieces of legislation to get it done.  But I’ll be doing something that’s somewhat preemptive but ultimately will be matched by legislation, I’m sure., We’re having a lot of problems with Democrats.  They don’t want to vote for anything.  They don’t care about lack of security.  They really would like to have open borders, where anybody in the world can just flow in, including from the Middle East.  From — anybody, anywhere, they can just flow into our country.  Tremendous problems with that.  Tremendous crime caused by that.  We’re just not going to do it., I do want to say that because we’re all so busy, and I just mentioned to the congressmen and the senators in the room, that we are going to cancel and postpone tomorrow’s Congressional Picnic.  We have a Congressional Picnic tomorrow.  And I was just walking over to the Oval Office and I said, you know, it doesn’t feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we’re working on — doing something very important.  We have many things that are important.  We’re talking about trade.  We’re talking about many, many things.  But it didn’t feel exactly right to me., So we will be officially postponing the Congressional Picnic for tomorrow.  We’ll make it another time when things are going extremely well.  And they are going, for the country, extremely well., We have record-setting numbers in every way economically, but we want to solve this immigration problem, which is going on for 40 years, more.  It’s been going on forever.  And we want to see if we can solve it.  So we are cancelling or postponing the Congressional Picnic tomorrow., Would anybody in the room have any question or a statement that you’d like to make while the press is here?  Anybody?  Anybody?, SENATOR SULLIVAN:  I’ll say one, Mr. President.  On the issue of immigration, trade, and investment, these are all areas where Congress has a lot of authority under the Constitution, and you have authority; the executive branch has authority under the Constitution.  And I think that’s why meetings like this are really important, bringing the leadership on both sides together because of important issues., So appreciate the opportunity to let you see our views, hear our views on these issues, where we share authority on important matters.  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  And we all very much have the same views.  We want to keep family together; at the same time, we have to be strong on the border.  Otherwise, you’ll have millions of people coming up — not thousands, like we have now; you’ll have millions of people flowing up and just overtaking the country.  And we’re not letting that happen., So we have to be very strong on the border, but, at the same time, we want to be very compassionate., Yes.  Lamar., REPRESENTATIVE SMITH:  Mr. President, thanks for having us.  I think what Dan said was good.  We really have — on the issues, on trade, on immigration — we have a partnership under the Constitution.  We have some authority; the President has some authority.  We need to work together., I was thinking this morning, when we look at President Nixon’s portrait in the White House, we think that he did the unexpected and he went to China, because he could do that; he was in a position to do it.  And President Reagan did the unexpected.  He went to the Berlin Wall and Moscow., And when we were here a year ago, I think I suggested to you that immigration, which has bedeviled us for 40 years, as you’ve said — I believe you can — you’re the President who can help us solve the immigration problem with your leadership.  You may be able to do for immigration what Nixon did for China and Reagan did for the Soviet Union.  And a lot of us would like to work with you on that., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Lamar, very much., We need the Democrats’ support, because we need their votes.  It’s very simple.  You know, people say we have a majority.  Well, we have a one majority in the Senate.  We need 60.  Unfortunately, we don’t go with the majority; we go with 60.  Someday, somebody will explain why, but that’s the way it is.  We have — we need 60 votes; we have 51 votes at the most.  So we need Democrat votes in order to do it, otherwise you can’t do it., Tom, you were going to say something?  Tom Cotton., SENATOR COTTON:  I think it’s very important that we protect our border.  We cannot allow a child to be a “get out of jail free” card and a “get into the U.S. free” ticket., But at the same time, as you’ve said, as we’ve all said, we’d like to keep families together, keep them together at the border for the orderly and timely processing of the adults immigration claim.  If it’s a lawful, legitimate claim, we can admit the family into the country.  If not, they’ll have to go back to their home country., I’m glad you’re looking for a solution for that.  I know that we, in Congress, are working on legislation that will allow our hardworking Border Patrol agents to keep families together at the border while we process their claims in a timely fashion., THE PRESIDENT:  You’re right.  And you bring up something that I have to say.  Our Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents have done one great job.  ICE is throwing — we’re throwing, by the thousands, MS-13.  They come into the country.  We’re liberating towns on Long Island and other places.  We’re throwing them out by the thousands.  But we need laws that don’t allow them to come back in., Mac, you’ve been very involved in this issue.  Do you have anything to say?, REPRESENTATIVE THORNBERRY:  Well, Mr. President, there are a number of issues that we’re going to be able to discuss today that touch on our country’s national security.  And certainly, controlling who and what comes across our border is an element of national security, as we do the compassionate thing with families., And I look forward to working with you to further strengthen our military.  Together, we have turned around a declining situation.  But that’s also part of what we need to do together.  In fact, to Lamar’s point about we both have responsibilities, we can do more together., THE PRESIDENT:  I will say, with all of the numbers that you see, if we weren’t strong on the border, you’d have hundreds of thousands of people pouring through the border.  They’d just be pouring through, and the country would not be the country anymore., Lindsey?, SENATOR GRAHAM:  We’ve got a big massive mess that’s been going on for decades, and we’re all going to fix it one day, I hope.  But we got a specific problem that puts the country in a dilemma.  Here’s your dilemma and was President Obama’s dilemma, and our dilemma: If a family shows up at the border and we let the family go into the country, and say please come back for your hearing, about 80 percent of the time the adults never show up for the hearing.  I think most Americans feel like that is bad; it will create a third wave of illegal immigration., I want to be fair to people who came here under the old system, but I don’t want to create incentives to create a third wave., The other choice is, is if you detain the parents who broke the law, under the Flores decision you have to break the family up.  So there’s a 1997 Supreme Court case that we’ve got to deal with., So I would urge my Democratic friends to see if we can find a way to keep families together, have a legislative fix of the Flores decision, and argue about the other things later., Because right now, Mr. President, you’re in a real bind.  If you detain the adults, the law requires the children to be separated.  If you let the adults into the country, they’d never show up.  It seems to me that we want to keep the family together and have the parents show up for their day in court., To Senator Schumer: I know there’s a lot we don’t agree on, but surely to goodness we can fix this court decision, because the country is in a bad spot, not just you., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Lindsey, the dilemma is that if you’re weak — if you’re weak, which people would like you to be — if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country is going to be overrun with millions of people.  And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart.  That’s a tough dilemma.  Perhaps I’d rather be strong, but that’s a tough dilemma., SENATOR JOHNSON:  Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead, Ron., SENATOR JOHNSON:  In our community, homeland security, we’ve held 30 hearings on border security.  And you know how much I like data.  And, you know, Senator Graham mentioned the fact that we have these incentives.  There’s nothing compassionate, by the way, of enticing people to take a very dangerous journey on a train they call “the beast,” or through the desert.  We’ve seen the pictures of dead — desiccated bodies in the desert.  There’s nothing compassionate about that., But here’s what’s happened since 2012, since DACA.  Just to talk about unaccompanied children: Prior to that, somewhere between 3,000 or 4,000 unaccompanied children from Central America came into this country.  Then DACA was instituted in 2012, and that problem skyrocketed.  The numbers on it — about 225,000 unaccompanied children, just from Central America; about almost half a million family members.  So we’ve got another 750,000 individuals — very sympathetic — that we’re just incentivizing for coming.  And we have to stop those incentives., Our goal of our policy should be to reduce the flow of people incentivized to come to this country, and that’s what strong enforcement actually does., THE PRESIDENT:  So just so everybody knows, this deal was just about done.  We had a deal signed.  President Obama signed DACA.  When he signed it, he said, I’m really not allowed to sign this, and I’m going to sign it anyway.  But he actually said, I’m not allowed to sign this, never going to hold up.  And they got a judge who held it up, and they got another one who held it up.  Then we had a couple that turned it down, and it’s going to be a Supreme Court issue., But before it was held up, everyone assumed that the DACA would not be held up.  But we had a deal with the Democrats.  It was a deal that everybody agreed to.  It was $25 billion.  We were going to build a wall.  We would take care of many, many different things, including loopholes.  And it was all done, except when this judge ruled in favor of DACA, meaning that it could continue until we get to the Supreme Court, all of a sudden, they weren’t there anymore.  And that’s what happened, and that’s why we’re in this mess — because we had a couple of court decisions, which is going to force an issue to the Supreme Court that shouldn’t be forced to the Supreme Court., Yes, John., SENATOR HOEVEN:  Thanks for inviting up on these important issues, and for having this important discussion certainly on immigration, but also on trade.  And the context that I want to make sure we talk about is, we’ve made incredible progress on tax relief, we’ve made tremendous progress on regulatory relief, and it’s reflected in our economy.  Now, if we can do the same thing on trade, think what that means for our country in terms of economic growth, in terms of jobs, in terms of getting wages moving higher, and the impact that has for all Americans., So we have to look at in that context.  When we talk about trade, it’s on top of tax relief, regulatory relief.  And now, if we can get the right policies in place on trade, think what that means for our country., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re doing very well on trade, I will say.  We’ve been really hurt as a country on trade, for many years.  Despite bad trade deals, we’re doing very well.  And now we’re making very good trade deals.  Well, you’ll be seeing that.  They’ll be announced pretty rapidly.  We already have a couple that are made.  But we’re making great trade deals., And honestly, we need people coming into our country.  You know, we have a lot of companies coming into our country: Chrysler just announced.  We have Foxconn is going up to Wisconsin, as you know, and a great company.  They make the Apple iPhones and laptops and — unbelievable company.  We need people.  We need people that work for these companies because they’re coming in at a number that nobody ever thought possible., So we want people to come into our country, but I think I can speak for everybody at the table: We want them to come in based on merit.  We want great people that will be great for our country.  And we want them to come in based on merit.  We’re going to need those people because we have so many companies coming to the country., John, you were going to say something?, SENATOR CORNYN:  Mr. President, to your point, America is the most generous country in the world when it comes to legal immigration.  And I think we ought to draw a very clear line between legal immigration that benefits our country —, THE PRESIDENT:  Right, absolutely., SENATOR CORNYN:  — and illegal immigration, which is a threat to public safety., I just wanted to make the one point.  I agree with what Tom Cotton and others have said, what you’ve said, about being able to enforce the law and keep families together.  It’s not a mutually exclusive choice.  We can do both.  And I’m confident we will achieve that goal., But I just want to point out that, coming from a border state, like Mac and I do, the border — the illegality along the border is a complex problem because it is — as somebody pointed out, it’s “commodity agnostic.”  In other words, they said it’s people, it’s drugs, it’s weapons.  And you talk about an opioid crisis in the United States — it’s not just prescription drugs; it’s heroin that comes from Mexico., THE PRESIDENT:  Right., SENATOR CORNYN:  So this is a very complex situation.  We need law and order along the border.  Everybody agrees with that.  We need to be compassionate in the way we handle these families.  But it’s important to remember that larger context, because the cartels and the criminal organizations that benefit from this, they’re just making a lot of money and keeping this situation very dangerous for everybody involved., THE PRESIDENT:  And, John, in many ways, they’re using the children and always — they’re using the children as a ticket to getting into the country., SENATOR CORNYN:  Absolutely., THE PRESIDENT:  And we have to remember that.  You know, there’s a number of the 12,000 children; 2,000 are with the parents, and 10,000 came up with some really horrible people, in some cases.  You have the coyotes, you have the traffickers — the human traffickers — not only drug traffickers, but you have the human traffickers.  And they use these children as passports to get into the country.  So we have to work on that, too.  It’s a very complex issue., It has been going on — you shouldn’t feel guilty, because it’s been going on for many, many years.  Many, many decades.  But we’re going to solve that, along with a lot of other problems that we’ve already solved.  We’re doing well at solving problems., You know, when I became President, we had North Korea; we had the Iran deal, which was no good; we had lots of problems with trade and bad trade deals.  There are a lot of things that we’ve solved and we’re solving that, in theory, I shouldn’t have had to solve.  These are things that should have been solved for a long time.  Even on trade., We should have never allowed our past leaders — should have never allowed China to get to a point where there’s a $500 billion trade deficit with the United States.  When they went up, we should have gone up.  We should have gone up together — not where you allowed one to get so far ahead.  And that includes the European Union and it includes many others.  Shouldn’t have happened., So we came at a time where there were plenty of problems to solve, and one of the big problems is immigration.  And I hope that within not too long a distance — and I mean beyond just one problem of immigration.  You can mention the word “comprehensive,” or you don’t have to use it.  A lot of politicians don’t like the word “comprehensive immigration reform.”  But I really think we have an opportunity to redo the whole immigration picture, and that’s what I’m looking to do, ultimately.  But right now, we want to fix this problem and I think we’ll be able to do that., Does anybody else — David, do you want to say something?, SENATOR PERDUE:  Well, Mr. President, the last year and a half has shown an absolute turnaround in this economy.  I mean, we were faced with eight years of 1.9 percent economic growth.  We focused on, as John said, regulation, energy, taxes.  This year, we’ve put a Dodd-Frank bill — a bipartisan bill, and we freed up a couple trillion dollars., And what this administration has done is freed up $6 trillion to go back into the economy.  This is real jobs — 3.5 million new jobs, 870 regulations reversed.  This economy is moving.  The rest of world is paying attention., NATO has doubled their investment in terms of their military spending.  We have a new free trade agreement with Korea.  We’re heading in the right direction.  I just hope that we can focus on the priorities right now, within this trade equation, to get equal access.  It’s not right and Alibaba can do cloud computing in the U.S., and Google can’t do cloud computing in China.  And that’s what this is all about., We’ve reduced global poverty by two-thirds in the last 40 years, while poverty in the United States has remained flat.  That’s not right.  And this is moving to change that., THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Jim?, SENATOR INHOFE:  I appreciate the fact that you call attention to what’s really happening now with the economy, due to two things: the tax bill and the regulations.  You know, we’re killing people with the regulations.  But what hasn’t been said around this table, and I’m surprised, the biggest accomplishment from your administration is what you’ve done with the military., You succeeded a President who had a policy that said you can’t do anything with sequestration, with the military, unless you do it with the non-defense.  And we changed that.  We had to vote for a lousy budget bill to do it, but nonetheless, it is changed.  We’ve broken parity, and we’re now rebuilding our military., THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.  The military is really incredible.  We’re ordering new planes, new ships — all jobs too.  You know, jobs, I would say, in this case is a far second.  But we’re going to have a military like we’ve never had before, and it’s great.  $700 billion approved and $716 [billion].  And in that budget, $6 billion for opioid.  That’s an important thing, too., So a lot of progress is being made., Mike, did you have something to say?  Mike Pence?, THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I just — I know I speak for the President when I express the gratitude of this administration for the support of the members of the Senate and the House that are gathered around here.  You’ve delivered for the American people on national security and rebuilding our military; on tax cuts and regulatory reform, restoring our economy., But what the President reiterated again yesterday, and he has said every day from when he sought this office, is we have a crisis of illegal immigration.  And as the President made clear, we don’t want families to be separated.  We don’t want children taken away from parents.  But right now, under the law — and we sit with these lawmakers — we only have two choices before us:  Number one is, don’t prosecute people who come into our country illegally, or prosecute them and then, under court cases and the law, they have to be separated from their children., What I want to be clear about is we’re calling on these lawmakers, Mr. President, not just to solve this problem in a way that affirms our commitment to law and order and compassion, which we can do.  And there are proposals in the Senate and proposals in the House to do that.  But the President’s vision, articulated in his State of the Union address, was let’s solve the whole problem.  Let’s build a wall, let’s close the loopholes, let’s solve the problem for 1.8 million people that were brought into this country through no fault of their own, and let’s deal with law and order and compassion with this issue of family separation at our borders., And I would say, with great respect to the members of Congress, as the House considers legislation tomorrow and the Senate is considering legislation, the President has postponed the Congressional Picnic — we’re calling on Congress to act.  Let’s roll our sleeves up, let’s work the whole problem.  Let’s end this crisis of illegal immigration., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Does anybody else have anything to say?  Because I think we’re pretty much — yes, Adam., REPRESENTATIVE KINZINGER:  Mr. President, thank you.  And just from the House perspective, I want to say — and as a still-currently serving Guard member — you’re my Commander-in-Chief — there has been a marked difference in the security and the good feelings in the military.  They understand that we’re investing in them again, even though we’re asking them to do a lot., And secondly, security plays a big role.  So that includes border security.  And the bill that we’re going to bring up, and hopefully pass in the House this week, fully funds the border and takes care of all these issues.  And I hope the House can pass it.  And I wish Democrats would join us, because frankly, it’s a lot of stuff in there that they like, too.  It’s an 80 percent issue.  Unfortunately, I think they like the politics of this a little better., And I also want to say, we really wish you didn’t take Secretary Pompeo from the House, because he did a great job.  (Laughter.)  He’s doing a great job., THE PRESIDENT:  He’s doing a great job.  He is doing a great job.  Thank you, Adam, very much.  Appreciate it., Anybody over here?  Yes., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to echo particularly what Chairman Thornberry and Senator Inhofe said in terms of the change that we’ve seen — and Adam as well — the change we’ve seen in terms of resources for the military.  We got to make sure we don’t have another CR for the military., THE PRESIDENT:  Right., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY:  And we are working hard in the House.  We’re hopeful we’re going to pass defense appropriations bill next week in the House.  And we need to make sure that that gets taken up and passed in the Senate, and that we don’t give you another omnibus-type bill —, THE PRESIDENT:  Please.  Please, that would be very nice., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY: — that we get a straight defense appropriations bill passed and taken up.  And that will be critically important to continue the work you’ve done to rebuild the military., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Liz.  And say hello to your father, please., REPRESENTATIVE CHENEY:  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  Great guy., PARTICIPANT:  Can you tell Adam to shave — (laughter.), THE PRESIDENT:  He looks good.  Handsome guy., So thank you all very much.  We appreciate it., Q    Mr. President, are you supporting (inaudible) to keep families together?  (Inaudible) executive order?, THE PRESIDENT:  We are.  We’re looking to keep families together.  It’s very important., Q    Are you signing an executive order?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to be signing an executive order.  We’re going to also count on Congress, obviously.  But we are signing an executive order in a little while.  We’re going to keep families together, but we still have to maintain toughness, or our country will be overrun by people, by crime, by all of the things that we don’t stand for, that we don’t want., ...]

       "26   [President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are pleased to announce that the following individuals will be their special guests, seated with the First Lady, at the President’s first State of the Union address:, : Corey Adams is a skilled welder at Staub Manufacturing Solutions in Dayton, Ohio, where he has worked for more than eight years. During 2017, Corey and his wife were able to become first-time homeowners, and they will invest their extra money from tax reform into their two daughters’ education savings., : Elizabeth Alvarado and Robert Mickens are the parents of Nisa Mickens. Evelyn Rodriguez and Freddy Cuevas are the parents of Kayla Cuevas. Nisa and Kayla had been close friends since elementary school, but in September 2016, the two girls were chased down and brutally murdered. Their deaths were among a string of 17 Long Island slayings that have been attributed to Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13., : Matthew Bradford joined the United States Marine Corps straight out of high school and deployed to Iraq in 2006. In 2007, he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED). Shrapnel shot into both of his eyes, blinding him, and the explosion also took both of his legs. After multiple surgeries and therapy, Matthew reenlisted in the Marine Corps—the first blind, double amputee to do so., : Jon Bridgers founded the Cajun Navy 2016, as a non-profit rescue and recovery organization to respond to flooding in south Louisiana. In 2017, the Cajun Navy set out to provide aid to those in Texas affected by Hurricane Harvey. He and the Cajun Navy 2016 have helped thousands of people across the South, and to this day, they are helping collect resources and donations for those who lost their homes in the storms., : David Dahlberg works as a fire prevention technician in southern California, stationed at the Pine Canyon Fire Station in the Santa Lucia Ranger District. In July 2017, he saved 62 children and staff members from a raging wildfire that had encircled their camp., : Ryan Holets serves as a police officer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In his six years on the force, he has been shot at twice and experienced several near-death encounters. Officer Holets and his wife adopted a baby from parents who suffered from opioid addiction, breaking down walls between drug addicts and police officers to help save lives., : Ashlee Leppert has dedicated her life to her country, serving as an aviation electronics technician in the United States Coast Guard. Last year, she rescued dozens of Americans imperiled during the devastating hurricane season. Nothing has left more of a mark on Ashlee than her efforts to lift a woman to safety in a helicopter basket. The woman was clutching a few bags of what Ashlee thought were clothes. As she drew the woman near, however, Ashlee saw four sets of children’s eyes looking at her as their guardian angel., : CJ Martinez is a Supervisory Special Agent for the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations unit. He has spent much of his 15-year tenure working to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, including MS-13. His investigations have led to more than 100 arrests of MS-13 gang members who have been prosecuted for crimes, including homicide, assault, and narcotics and weapons trafficking. CJ is a proud veteran, having honorably served our Nation in the United States Air Force and Air National Guard for more than 22 years., : Staff Sergeant Justin Peck has served in the United States Army for eight years. In November 2017, he was part of a team, along with Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, that was conducting a multi-day mission with partner forces in Raqqa, Syria, to clear IEDs from territory previously controlled by ISIS. After the team had located and disarmed seven IEDs, Chief Petty Officer Stacy was clearing the second floor of a hospital building when he was struck by an IED blast and severely wounded. Without hesitation, Staff Sergeant Peck, who was holding a position outside the building, rushed to Stacy’s location on the uncleared, IED-ridden second floor. Staff Sergeant Peck’s actions—including applying a tourniquet, placing an endotracheal tube, and performing artificial respirations and CPR—were directly responsible for saving Chief Petty Officer Stacy’s life., : Preston Sharp was visiting his veteran grandfather’s grave in 2015, when he noticed that other local veterans’ graves were not being honored with American flags or flowers. Today, Preston has organized the placement of more than 40,000 American flags and red carnations on soldiers’ graves, as part of his goal to honor veterans in all 50 States and to challenge others to join the Flag and Flower Challenge (#FandFChallenge)., : Siblings Steve Staub and Sandy Kepingler started Staub Manufacturing Solutions, a contract manufacturing company specializing in metal fabrication, twenty years ago.  Today, they serve as president and vice president, respectively. Thanks to the “Trump bump” in their business, Staub Manufacturing Solutions has seen an uptick in sales, employment, and optimism. They have grown their team from 23 to 37 employees over the last year and recently expanded by acquiring a new building. Following enactment of the tax cuts and reform legislation last year, they were able to give all their employees larger than expected Christmas bonuses., .]

       "27   [Nucor Warehouse, Auburn, NY, 2:35 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Auburn.  (Applause.), Thank you, Jason Curtis, for that kind introduction.  It’s an honor to be with you and a lot of great, hardworking Americans who are proving every day, here at Nucor Steel Auburn that steel is back in America.  (Applause.), I’m grateful for the warm welcome and grateful for the opportunity to share a few moments with all of you to talk about the progress that we’re making as a country., I’m also grateful to be joined today by a great partner for prosperity here in the state in New York and in Auburn, and a great, great champion of American steel, Congressman John Katko.  Thank you, congressman.  (Applause.), But let me begin today by bringing greetings — bringing greetings from a great champion of American steel and a proud New Yorker.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), And before I begin, let me take a moment — let me take a moment to address an issue that is, I know, much on the minds of people across this country today, the ongoing crisis of illegal immigration at our southern border.  The President spoke about it earlier today and I wanted to address it as I was gathered with you, my fellow Americans, here in Auburn., Make no mistake about it: The crisis of illegal immigration at our southern border is a direct result of the failed immigration policies — policies that have failed to secure our border — and a result of crippling loopholes in our immigration laws that too often induce vulnerable families to make a long and dangerous journey up the peninsula to attempt to illegally enter this country, resulting in a loss of their liberty and sometimes — and sometimes worse., As the President said today, “We want to solve this problem.”  We “don’t want children taken away from their parents.”, The truth is, our weak immigration laws have had dire consequences.  As the President said today, the loopholes in our immigration laws today have caused roughly half a million illegal immigrants from Central America to be released into our country since 2014, impacting American communities, American families, and American jobs., It is tragic that these failed immigration policies have created this incentive for vulnerable families and literally put vulnerable adults and children in danger.  This is simply unacceptable, and I want to assure my fellow Americans gathered here today that that’s the case.  It’s unacceptable to this administration and unacceptable to the American people., But as the President explained today, under current law we only have one of two options.  To respond to this crisis of illegal immigration, “We can either release all illegal immigrant families, including minors who show up” at our southern border, or we can prosecute “adults for the federal crime of illegal entry.”  Neither of these options solve the problem that we face today.  And that’s why President Trump, again today called on the Congress to pass immigration reform and to pass immigration right away.  (Applause.), Working with members of Congress — this week Congress will consider legislation that will build a wall, secure our border, close loopholes, and enact the kind of reforms that give us the legal authority to detain and remove families together.  And this legislation would also allow us to permanently resolve the issues surrounding individuals who are brought into this country over many years through no fault of their own., Congress will take up that legislation this week.  And I want to personally thank Congressman John Katko for taking the principles that President Trump articulated in his State of the Union Address and helping to enwrap them into legislation.  Congressman Katko, thank you for working on this issue in a principled and a compassionate way.  (Applause.), I just want to promise all of you, as the headlines continue to unfurl over the coming days, President Trump and I are going to continue to work tirelessly with your Congressman and with members of Congress to close these crippling loopholes in our immigration laws, to build a wall to secure our border, and to solve the crisis of illegal immigration once and for all.  (Applause.), Now, again, it’s an honor to be here at Nucor Steel Auburn, and particularly to see the extraordinary new rolling mill that just opened in the last year., As President Trump said, steel workers are the backbone of America.  And he knows what he’s talking about because the hardworking men and women of Cayuga County elected a builder to be President of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  This President loves men and women who know how to make things., And on behalf of that builder, I’m here today at the largest steel producer in the country simply to say thank you.  Thank you to each and every one of you who make Nucor Steel a success here in Auburn and all those you represent in this great company around America., It’s amazing to think, for almost a half a century, Nucor has been a key part of why the steel in America is the best steel in the world.  In fact, I’m told that some of the greatest buildings in this country, including One World Trade Center and Yankee Stadium in New York City, were all built with Nucor steel., Since 1974, this mill in Auburn has led the way in producing world-class rebar.  And as your recent expansion demonstrates, under President Trump, we are forging a new American future built on American steel.  (Applause.), Truth is, this mill is actually a powerful symbol — a powerful symbol of an American comeback not just in steel, but in every area of our economy.  Since the first day of this administration, President Trump and I have been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people.  We’ve rolled back federal red tape.  We’ve unleashed American energy.  I don’t know if you noticed it, but last year, as the President was approving the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, he also signed an executive order requiring all new energy pipelines be built with American steel.  (Applause.), The President has also been fighting every day for the kind of fair deals for trade that put American jobs and American workers first., As the President has said, “If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country.”  And what this President and I both understand, that to have a strong and secure America, America needs steel to be strong.  We didn’t build those battleships with plastic.  We’re going to make sure that American steel is there now and for generations to come for a stronger and more secure America.  (Applause.), And beyond steel and aluminum, the President has also made it clear that we’re going to keep fighting for other areas of this economy here in upstate New York, particularly when it comes to dairy farmers., New York’s dairy farmers are the best in the world, and President Trump is fighting for the kind of free and fair trade deal with Canada that puts American dairy farmers first.  And we’re going to keep fighting.  (Applause.), You know, the truth is, for too long Canada’s price manipulations have been impacting dairy farmers here in upstate New York.  And I can assure you the President is going to continue to use all the tools at his disposal to negotiate deals that will ensure the ongoing prosperity of our dairy farmers., And just before Christmas, I hope you all noticed — just a few days before Christmas, the President kept one of his signature promises to the American people when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.  (Applause.), Well, we know once these tax cuts take full effect the average working family of four in Central New York is going to save more than $2,400 a year in taxes., But we also cut taxes on businesses, like Nucor Steel, so that companies here in America can compete and win against companies anywhere in the world., I specifically want to thank your Congressman, John Katko, one more time, who took a strong and courageous stand for working families here in New York, for businesses large and small in New York.  Thank you, Congressman Katko, for supporting tax cuts to make this state and country great again.  (Applause.), I also, lastly, just want to thank Nucor Steel for the example that this company is setting in support of the pro-growth policies that President Trump and I and our entire administration have been advancing with the strong support of leaders in Congress.  The truth is, steel is back and Nucor Steel has proven that every day., In fact, since Election Day 2016, I’m told Nucor has already announced over $2.1 billion in new investments to upgrade new equipment.  Later this summer, you’re going to celebrate the one-year anniversary of that $30 million investment, that beautiful new rolling mill just behind me.  And all these investments Nucor Steel is making are projected to create more than 745 good-paying jobs here and all across America.  Let’s hear it for a company that’s investing in America.  Thank you, Nucor.  (Applause.), But the truth is, this company is hardly alone.  Since Election Day 2016, I’m proud to report that companies, large and small, have created 3.4 million new jobs all across this country, including 174,400 new jobs all across the state of New York., Unemployment hasn’t been this low in nearly 50 years.  And unemployment for women is at a 20-year low.  And employment for African Americans and Hispanics has never been lower.  Men and women, we’re bringing back the American Dream for every American.  (Applause.), But you know, for all that we’ve accomplished with the strong support of your congressman and other partners in Washington, D.C., for all that companies, like Nucor, have been able to do in the last year and a half, I can assure you that that New Yorker that I work with every day, that’s just what he calls a good start.  And I want to promise you: We’re going to continue to work tirelessly — we’re going to continue to work tirelessly to support American steel and American jobs.  We’ll continue to fight for an economy that’s growing, and prospering, and working for every American., And as I leave here today, inspired by the example of all of you and by a company that is investing again in American jobs and in America’s future, I leave here with renewed confidence that with your continued support and example, and your hard work in this great company, with the strong support of leaders in Congress like Congressman John Katko, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I just know in my heart that we will make America safe again.  We will make America prosperous and strong again.  And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again., Thank you, Nucor Steel.  (Applause.)  We’re proud of you.  Keep up the great work, and God bless you all.  Thank you very much., END, 2:49 P.M.

       "28   [U.S. Capitol, \\nWashington, D.C., 12:12 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Speaker Ryan, for that wonderful toast — although I’ve heard better jokes. (Laughter.) And thank you to all of our friends and distinguished members of Congress for joining us here today — a great honor. And a really great honor to be with you, Vice President Pence. You have been terrific. (Applause.), And all of our friends welcoming Taoiseach. That’s my new friend; he’s my new friend. Great guy. (Applause.) And, Fionnuala, you know, you are something very special. We sat, we talked, and I think we’re friends now too, right? And it’s really an honor. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thanks, Fionnuala. Appreciate it., Also, the delegation members — very, very special. Spent some time together, and we’re going to have a very, very great long-term relationship, as we would with Ireland anyway. But this is a very special group, so I very much appreciate it., We’re here today to celebrate America’s commitment to Ireland and the tremendous contributions — and I know it well — the Irish immigrants and their descendants have made right here in the United States and throughout the world. The very first St. Patrick’s Day parade — I spent a lot of time at St. Patrick’s Day parades over the years, I will tell you that – was held in my hometown, New York City, on March 17th, 1762. With each subsequent year, the Irish people marched, passed another accomplishment, and celebrated another very hard-earned success. And they have had tremendous success all over the world, but in this country they have had tremendous success., Over the years, they marched past the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, now an immortal monument to the faith of Irish Catholics in America. They celebrated their shared success in American society with the election of John F. Kennedy. (Applause.) They fought for America in war and combat. And their battlefield courage has earned admiration and acclaim throughout the world. They have great courage., The proud tradition that started in 1762 has flourished and is now celebrated by Americans of all faiths and backgrounds all across our very beautiful and very special land. As we stand together with our Irish friends, I’m reminded of that proverb — and this is a good one, this is one I like; I’ve heard it for many, many years and I love it — “Always remember to forget the friends that proved untrue. But never forget to remember those that have stuck by you.” We know that, politically speaking. A lot of us know that, we know it well. (Applause.) It’s a great phrase., The people of Ireland and the people of the United States have stuck together through good times and bad times. Over many centuries we have built a bond that thrives, inspires and endures. And with us, it’s going to be closer than ever before, I can tell you that. (Applause.), So as we celebrate our shared history and our enduring friendship, let us commit ourselves to working together, as we will, to build on that bond for the benefit of our citizens for many more generations to come., Thank you. God bless you. And may God always bless our deep and lasting friendship and relationship. We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland. Thank you very much for being here. (Applause.), SPEAKER RYAN: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It is now my pleasure to introduce An Taoiseach, our friend, Enda Kenny. (Applause.), TAOISEACH KENNY: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you., Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, members of, Congress, ambassadors, friends of Ireland, distinguished guests., (Speaks in Irish.), I didn’t say anything disparaging about you there. (Laughter.) What I said was, it’s a pleasure for me to be here, along with my wife, Fionnuala, to be amongst this august gathering. And on behalf of the government of Ireland and the people of Ireland, I wish you all a very happy St. Patrick’s festival for you all., They say the Irish have the capacity to change everything. I just saw the President of the United States read from his script, entirely. (Laughter and applause.) I was going to say “a change is coming.” (Laughter.), Paul, it’s a pleasure. And thank you for your visit to Ireland when you called to see me in government buildings with your family and on your visit down to Kilkenny. When I had the privilege of speaking to the President on the telephone very shortly after his election, I said to him if it would be possible to continue this tradition, which began so many years ago, and he said, without hesitation, of course — followed by the Vice President and U.S. Speaker., This is a unique occasion for Ireland and for its people. To have the facility of being honored by the Speaker of the House, the access to the President of the United States, the Vice President, and most of the team is something that we really do cherish. It goes back a very long way from when Tip O’Neill and Ronald Reagan and all of the others put this together in the first place. So it’s a really important day for us, and we’re very grateful to stand between these two flags, united in history and so much., I haven’t had the opportunity to present you with a particular piece of sculpture which is entitled “Arrival,” by John Behan. It’s a miniature — but it’s quite large — of what stands at the United Nations in New York of the tale and the story and the history of Irish immigrants after the famine years., So let me congratulate you, President Trump, on your election. You beat them all. (Laughter and applause.) Whatever they say, elections are tough-going. I know, I’ve been through 20 of them myself. (Laughter.) But the President and the Vice President and this administration now holds within its hands the responsibility of dealing with so many global international issues in a world that is changing so rapidly and that is so fragile in so many respects. And I know that you will do your utmost to work in the interests of our common humanity, and you will have the prayers and the support of the Irish people. And let me say to you, and the European Union — and the work that you have to do in the times — in the challenging times ahead., We discussed the kind of driver that the President uses — Titleist, 9-degree loft, Doonbeg, wind off the Atlantic. You have to roll the wrist at the top to get that shot straight. And during the course of this presidency, President Trump will visit Ireland, and he said he would put the sticks in the hold of Air Force One., Anyway, let me just say a few words here about our country. We’ve come through a torrid time a number of years ago. When I took over the government back in 2011, we were blocked out of all the markets, the Troika were in town, our sovereignty was gone, our hope was gone; hemorrhage of immigration, and a falloff in all business right across every sector., Now, because of the sacrifices of the people and tough choices made, we’re in a different spot. Unemployment, which was 15.2, is now down to 6.6 percent and falling. Employment is the highest in 10 years. A growth rate of 5.2 percent last year. Fourth year running. Ireland is the fastest-growing country in Europe. Deficit eliminated next year. Two million-plus working now. I was accused in Cork three weeks ago of blocking up the Irish roads with people going to work. (Laughter and applause.) That’s the challenge of success, I suppose., It’s fair to say, as you know, Mr. President, we’ve got 700 Irish firms, and 65 percent of the 700 firms working in America have a full-time presence in this market. And they now employ 100,000 people across 50 states. And that’s because of our participation in the European Union and the confidence that our people have to expand now beyond their own shores. And this two-way conduit is to the mutual benefit of our people and of the United States. And let me say that Ireland and the European Union will never be anything but a friend to your country, to these United States here. (Applause.), And I want you to understand that all administrations, over the last 40 years and beyond, have worked in the interests of the fragility of our country. We’ve had our troubles. We’ve had real difficulties. And George Mitchell spoke last night at the Ireland Funds about the contribution that both Europe, and particularly the United States, made towards putting that fragile peace together. We’re glad to see Ian Paisley here and, indeed, Gerry Adams, who have had their difficulties. We have put it all together and have maintained a fragile peace. And that’s why it’s important that we recognize the contribution made by the United States to that peace, where we have no border and where people can live their lives as one would expect to contribute to their country and their economies. And all presidents and all administrations over the years have assisted us in that regard. (Applause.), So we want to protect this peace process, and I know that you’re going to work with us in that context also. We have agreed with the British government that there would be no return to the border, as it used to apply years ago, with customs, posts on major roads, and every other road blown up or impassable because of sectarian violence that that brought with it. We have banished that. We want to see it remain banished. And the political agreement is no return to that kind of border of the past, and the challenge is to implement that in a way that works in the interests of the people North and South., And let me say to you that as a member of the European Council, what we want to do is to work with America. I believe genuinely, with Europe having created 4.5 million jobs in the last three years, that we can work with the United States to create more employment here, create opportunities for so many millions of Americans. And it may well be that in a revised trade agenda, that we can do that to the mutual benefit of 500 million people in the European Union and your population here across the United States. We will work with this administration, Paul and Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, in the interests of everybody., Thank you, Peter King, and thank you, Richard Neal — I know you’re here somewhere — for the work you’ve done over the years with the (inaudible). (Applause.) It may well be that it might be appropriate for the government and the administration to have a desk here in Washington which will associate itself with Northern Ireland, so that in the event of contact having to be made, that there’s a voice to answer that., You had in the past envoys appointed to Northern Ireland on practically a full-time basis. I think we can work now as a priority to get this executive up and running in the next short period. But to have continued connection here with the administration would be very important, and I’m sure Peter and Rich will work at that., I just want to say, I had a very good meeting this morning with the Vice President and with General John Kelly. Sitting at the table, we were hosted by the Vice President in the traditional breakfast in the Naval Observatory. Didn’t get much chance to eat the breakfast, I have to say; it’s one of the difficulties in politics — it’s in front of you but you can’t get near it. (Laughter.) We did discuss the question of immigration, which is so important to the fabric of our people. And I know that in this country, this is an issue that the administration and the President are reflecting upon. And that’s something that, again, we will work with you diligently in this regard in the two sectors that we used to have a facility for E3 visas for young people who want to come to America and to work here. We discussed that very constructively this morning., And secondly, as a part of the overall immigration reform that the Irish have contributed so much, it would be part of that. And we look forward to the works that will take place at the time ahead., You might say that when Mike Pence’s grandfather landed here in Ellis Island in 1923, that the contribution had been made by so many Irish for so many years. It was in 1771 that the friendly Sons of St. Patrick were put together in Philadelphia, and one of their first honorary members was a young man called George Washington. And seven years later, he handed the first commission to a naval officer called John Barry, who was co-founder of the American Navy. And he was joined later by John Holland, who designed the first submarine. And he was followed by Louis Brennan, from my hometown, who had a major impact on the navigation systems for torpedoes., And so many others, from Henry Ford, through music and culture, and so many other areas, that 22 members of the American Presidents who sat in the White House had either Scots or Irish blood in them. And you follow in that line, sir., And I’d just like to say in finality, this is what I said to your predecessor on a number of occasions: We would like this to be sorted. It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And that’s what people want. (Applause.), I know you’ll reflect on this, but I’m always struck by the American National Anthem when it’s sung before the great occasions. And I suppose being an emotional Irishman, the hairs tingle at the back of your neck when you hear your own national anthem. But for us, when Old Glory waves, and you put your hand on your heart and you say, “The land of the free and the home of the brave,” ours is still as brave as ever, but maybe not as free. Because of the 4,000 Congressional Medals of Honor given out to the defense forces, over 2,000 go to the Irish Americans. So they fought in the Revolutionary War. They beat the daylights out of each other in Fredericksburg and Gettysburg and Yorktown, and other places, in Atlanta. They fought every war for America and died for America — and will continue to do so. All they want is the opportunity to be free., And this administration, working with Democrats and Republicans, I hope, can sort this out once and for all. And for future years, you determine what it is that you want to do. As George Mitchell said last evening, you can’t return to open immigration, but for the people who are here — who should be here, might be here — that’s an issue that I’m sure your administration will reflect on. And we in Ireland will give you every assistance in that regard., There are millions out there who want to play their part for America — if you like, who want to make America great. (Laughter.) Heard it before? Heard that before? (Applause.), So I see Vicki here in front of me. We didn’t get as far as the Kennedy Center the other evening. I was talking to young people the other day, they were on about all the different things that are happening in the world, and they reminded me of one of JFK’s statements: “This is our planet. Together, we shall save or we shall perish in its flames.”, We have work to do. Let’s eat. Thank you. (Applause.), END, \\n12:31 P.M.







       "29   [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 3:53 P.M. EDT, SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Many by now have heard that I was asked to leave a restaurant this weekend where I attempted to have dinner with my family.  My husband and I politely left and went home.  I was asked to leave because I work for President Trump., We are allowed to disagree, but we should be able to do so freely and without fear of harm.  And this goes for all people regardless of politics.  Some have chosen to push hate and vandalism against the restaurant that I was asked to leave from.  A Hollywood actor publicly encouraged people to kidnap my children., And this weekend, a member of Congress called for people to “push back” and make clear to those serving their country in this administration that they are not welcome anywhere, anytime, for anything., Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important, but the calls for harassment and push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable., America is a great country, and our ability to find solutions despite those disagreements is what makes us unique., That is exactly what President Trump has done for all Americans by building a booming economy, with record low unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics, the defeat of ISIS, and the ongoing work to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula., Earlier today, the President spoke with the new President of Colombia and congratulated him on his recent electoral victory.  President Trump noted the strong partnership between our two countries and discussed the security challenges the new Colombian government will face as he enters office., We are also working to set up a call between the President and the President of Turkey to reaffirm our strong bond.  We encourage Turkey to take steps to strengthen its democracy and continue progress toward resolving issues in the bilateral relationship., Lastly, and on a slightly lighter and more positive note, it should be an exciting national championship at the College World Series since the Arkansas Razorbacks will be playing and take on Oregon State starting tonight in Omaha.  So, go Hogs., And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Jonathan., Q    Sarah, I want to ask you about the President’s tweet over the weekend, where he said that people who cross the border illegally should be sent back with no court cases, no judges.  Does the President believe that undocumented immigrants have no due process rights whatsoever?, SANDERS:  Virtually all Americans agree that it makes no sense that an illegal alien sets one foot on American soil and then they would go through a three- to five-year judicial process to be removed the country.  Thousands of illegal aliens are removed every month without seeing an immigration judge as a result of procedures in current law, including voluntary removal and expedited removal.  Just because you don’t see a judge, doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process., The President is focused on securing our borders and reforming our immigration system to prevent the crisis at the border from getting worse., Q    But he’s saying no judges, no court cases.  So no opportunity to claim asylum, no opportunity to have their cases heard before a judge?, SANDERS:  No, like I just said, just because you don’t see a judge, doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process.  Also, the President would like to see us stop people from illegally entering the country at all.  We’d like to have secure borders.  The Democrats are the ones that want open borders.  The President would like us to secure the borders and have a very legal and easy immigration process so people can come here the right way, not the wrong way., John., Q    Just in addition to what Jon was asking, under current law — and you spoke to this — contiguous countries to the United States, like Mexico and Canada, where people can be removed on an expedited basis, they can basically just be taken to the nearest border crossing and sent back.  Does the President want to implement that type of policy for people from noncontiguous countries?  Is that what he’s looking for here?, SANDERS:  The President would certainly like to see more expedited removal.  But ultimately, the President would like to see our border secured so that we don’t have all of these problems to begin with.  The President wants to fix our immigration system completely, and not just tinker with it.  He actually wants us to have a system that works, and he wants to have a secure border., He doesn’t believe in the philosophy that Democrats do, that we should have open borders.  He wants to stop that.  He wants to stop the crime that comes into this country.  And that’s what we’re hoping to do, and we’d like to see Congress step up and work with us., Blake., Q    The President also said in the Oval Office that people have proposed adding 5,000 judges.  Who’s proposed to add 5,000 judges?  I’ve seen 750 as a max number., SANDERS:  There have been a number of different proposals; quite a few that we’ve seen.  We’ve laid out what we would like to see, and hopefully Congress will work with us to make that happen., Blake., Q    Sarah, thank you.  Let me ask you about a couple statements on trade.  What is the President’s reaction to the Harley-Davidson announcement today?  Does he still feel that tariffs are the way to go?SANDERS:  The President’s trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy, and this includes the creation of over 300,000 manufacturing jobs.  Unemployment is at 3.8 percent, the lowest since 2000.  And manufacturing confidence is at historic highs., The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies.  And President Trump will continue to push for free, fair, and reciprocal trade and hopes that the EU will join us in that., Q    And on the story about Chinese investments — curtailing possible Chinese tech investments — the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said five hours ago that a statement would be forthcoming, and we still don’t have it.  When might that be coming?  Or what exactly is that administration’s stance on this?, SANDERS:  Again, as the Secretary said, a statement would go out that targets all countries that are trying to steal our technology, and we expect that to be out soon.  We’ll keep you posted., John., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Back on immigration.  In terms of what the President envisions for the immigration policy that he’d like to see put in place, should asylum-seekers be able to get their case heard before an immigration judge?, SANDERS:  Certainly there is a process in order to go through.  There are points of entry that asylum seekers should go to, and we encourage them to work through the system and not come across the border illegally., In fact, anyone that goes to a port of entry seeking asylum will not be prosecuted, and we would encourage people to use the correct system and not try to break the law., Q    And one more, on trade, and following up on what Blake asked about Harley-Davidson.  They announced in an SEC filing they’re moving a significant amount of their operations to Europe because of the EU tariffs that were placed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  Is this what the President envisioned for what the impact would be by placing tariffs on the EU and the retaliation the EU has put on the U.S.?, SANDERS:  Again, the European Union is trying to punish U.S. workers because they have engaged repeatedly in unfair trade practices, and the President is saying enough is enough.  We’d like to work with the EU to work on a level playing field., Sorry, Steve, I did come to you.  Go ahead., Q    Yes.  The President today in the Oval Office, sitting next to the King of Jordan, mentioned some progress in the Middle East peace process, but he didn’t give us any specifics.  There’s been quite a bit of shuttle diplomacy going on in the last few days in the Middle East with Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt.  Do you have anything concrete to tell us about any sort of positive movement whatsoever from all of this?, SANDERS:  Again, we think that the meetings that took place over the last week with Senior Advisor Jared Kushner and Special Representative Jason Greenblatt, they met with a number of officials and principals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and Qatar last week., They discussed the situation in Gaza as well as the next stages of the peace effort.  We’re going to continue those conversations and we’re committed to the peace effort, and we’re going to keep working forward.  But those conversations were productive., Julie., Q    Sarah, the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said today that they’re no longer going to be referring people who cross the border without authorization for criminal charges if they’re traveling with children, which is essentially returned to the Obama administration practice and administrations before that.  Does the President support that approach?  And if so, does he regret trying to push forward on a zero-tolerance approach in the first place?, Q    No, the President certainly supports keeping families together, which he has outlined several times over the last week, but he’s also called on Congress to actually fix the system.  They’re the only ones that ultimately have the ability to change the law.  The President’s executive order has given a temporary solution to the problem, but it’s not permanent and we need Congress to step up.  We need Democrats to stop playing political games, do their jobs, work with this President, and let’s fix the problem at the border., Q    Can you talk about why you tweeted from your official account about the episode that you had the restaurant on Friday night?, SANDERS:  Sure.  I was responding to a number of news stories.  I’d been reached out to by over a dozen reporters and there were multiple news stories that had already been issued.  It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would to any other news-of-the-day story., Jeff., Q    Sarah, you said just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you don’t get due process.  Can you explain what you mean by that, specifically, and how the President envisions that this would work while still maintaining what the Constitution upholds in having a swift immigration system?, SANDERS:  Again, there are other ways for removal.  There are thousands of illegal aliens that are removed every month that don’t see judges.  Sometimes that’s through voluntary removal, and sometimes that’s through expedited removal.  Again, the President’s ultimate goal would be that we have actually a secure border and people aren’t coming into the country illegally, but that we have a system that works and the people that come into the country come in through a legal system., Q    What is the President doing specifically this week to ensure that Congress passes a bill?  He spent all week in Nevada talking about — or all weekend, excuse me, on Saturday — talking about how Democrats want open borders and crime.  But specifically, has he made phone calls to Republican members in the House where the bill is pending?  Has he tried to bring Democrats together?  What is he doing specifically to try and get a new law passed specifically, other than just railing against the current law?, SANDERS:  The President met with a number of lawmakers last week, talked with several over the weekend, some that he was with while he was traveling.  Last week, he made an open invitation to Democrat lawmakers that they were welcome to come to the White House to discuss what they’d like to see, because the President wants solutions.  We have yet to have any of them show up, actually willing to have those conversations, actually willing to fix the problem.  Instead, they’d rather rant and rave about not allowing members of the Trump administration to step foot in public., The President wants to see solutions.  That’s what we’re focused on.  It’s Congress’s job to do that, and we’ve laid out very clearly that we want to be part of that and what we’d like to see in that package., Q    Is Congress doing its job on this?, SANDERS:  Clearly, they aren’t.  If they haven’t passed a law to fix the system, then they haven’t.  Republicans have laid out a number of proposals that they support.  The President has voiced his support for those., Q    The bills are going to probably fail this week though.  The Republican bills will probably fail this week., SANDERS:  That’s because no Democrat will get on board and actually support a solution., Q    (Inaudible) a Republican issue.  Republicans cannot pass these Republican bills.  What is the President doing as the leader of the party to try to get Republican —, SANDERS:  Jeff, these aren’t Republican bills.  These are bills that fix a broken system.  They may have Republican sponsors, but these should be bipartisan.  This shouldn’t be complicated.  Look, the House has already passed over 500 pieces of legislation, but they can’t get through the Senate because Democrats refuse to actually find solutions.  We have 50 bills that passed just last week to address the opioid crisis that passed through the House.  The Senate still hasn’t taken then up.  Hopefully, they will.  And if they do, that will show that we actually can come up with bipartisan solutions.  And that’s what we’d like to see them do on immigration as well., Jill., Q    Can I follow up on Julie’s question about the zero-tolerance policy?  The President said last week, after signing the executive order, that he believed that zero tolerance was still important.  You guys made a point of the fact that the EO did not actually get rid of the policy.  How does that square with the fact that CBP is now saying that they are no longer referring for prosecution any adults who come in with children?, SANDERS:  Again, this is a temporary solution.  This isn’t going to last.  Congress still has to step up.  They still have to do their job.  This will only last a short amount of time, because we’re going to run out of space, we’re going to run out of resources in order to keep people together.  And we’re asking Congress to provide those resources and do their job., Q    Some sort of a temporary solution.  Does that mean at some point you’re going to change that policy back?, SANDERS:  We’re not changing the policy.  We’re simply out of resources.  And at some point, Congress has to do what they were elected to do, and that is secure our border, that is stop the crime coming into our country.  The country has made extremely clear that they don’t want open borders.  And Democrats need to understand that, and they need to work with Republicans and find some solutions., Q    And then just another one.  Other people had several., SANDERS:  Sorry, Jill.  I’m going to keep going.  Annie, go ahead., Q    Sarah, you mentioned the state of resources and running out of them.  Can you be specific about what the resources are right now for housing parents and children together?  Is there enough housing right now?  Is the Pentagon stepping in?  Like, what’s being done about the resources?, SANDERS:  Again, we’re looking at every option available.  We have asked the Pentagon to help with additional space.  But a lot of that will depend on our ability to stop people coming into the country illegally.  And we, again, encourage people to go through ports of entry instead of crossing the border illegally., We’ve requested through legislation — we’re working with Congress, hopefully — to provide more resources and the ability to actually enforce the law., Ayesha., Q    I just want to see if you can kind of narrow down exactly what the President actually intends to do when it comes to this idea of not having judges.  You say that there are instances where people don’t have judges.  But my understanding is that if you do ask for asylum, you do have certain rights.  So is there going to be a change in that policy?  Or what is this administration planning to do to make it so you don’t have to see a judge (inaudible)?, SANDERS:  I’ve addressed this a couple of times.  There are multiple instances in where you wouldn’t: voluntary removal, certain cases of expedited removal.  If somebody comes through a port of entry seeking asylum, those cases and that process will be heard.  But at the same time, the President’s ultimate goal is to secure the border and stop illegal immigration., Q    I understand that.  But so what does that mean practically?  Like, is the President planning to do anything differently, or you’re just saying he doesn’t like the way things work now?, SANDERS:  The President has laid out what he’d like to see.  We’ve put out the things that we want to see in an immigration package months ago.  We’re still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that., Q    So unless Congress acts, nothing is actually going to change?  The administration is not changing anything right now when it comes to judges?, SANDERS:  You mean, are we walking around making up laws?  No.  Because we’re not the Obama administration.  We’re actually trying to enforce the laws that are on the books.  We’re actually asking Congress to do their part in the process and pass new legislation that will fix our immigration system., Q    So, but nothing is actually changing on the ground?  So this is — the President is complaining about judges and saying that we shouldn’t have all these judges, and people who come over should just be put out, but nothing is actually going to change?  He’s just saying — he’s just complaining about the process as it stands now?, SANDERS:  Things that we have the ability to do administratively we are working to do.  But again, Congress is the only one that has the ability to write law, and we hope they’ll do that this week., Steve., Q    Honing in on that point, I’m trying to understand what it is the President understands about the current policy.  Because as you’ve explained, expedited removal allows the government to remove hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants a year without seeing judges.  Did the President know that when he issued the tweets?, SANDERS:  Yeah, but there are still thousands that go through a very lengthy process.  We’d like to see the process consolidated.  We’d like to see the backlog stopped.  We’d like to see our border secured., Q    Well, just to follow up — under current law —, SANDERS:  Sorry, Steve, I’m going to keep moving., Q    — there are a couple of things that the President could do.  He could expand that policy.  You’ve said that he would like to see more expedited removal.  Does the President intend to expand it to the full two-year limit under the current statute?, SANDERS:  Again, we would like to see more expedited removal.  But ultimately, we would like to see the border secured and people stop coming into the country illegally.  That seems pretty simple to me.  And it would stop a lot of the problems, and would eliminate the need for so many of these additional laws., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  You began the briefing talking about the importance of civility.  Do you consider it a civil policy to separate more than two-thirds of children from their parents?, SANDERS:  We consider enforcing the law the role that the administration has to play.  Certainly the President has taken an executive action to the furthest that he has the ability to do to minimize the separation of families.  We’re working hard to make sure families get to stay together, and we’re calling on Congress to help us in that effort.  And we’re continuing to focus on the reunification and making sure that the families, again, stay together and that Congress will give us a permanent solution to fix that., Q    Would you say that they’re working to make families stay together?  It was your administration that separated them in the first place., SANDERS:  It wasn’t our administration that created these laws, but it is our administration’s job to enforce it, and we’ve done that.  If someone breaks the law, it’s our job to enforce it.  If somebody doesn’t like the law, then they need to lobby Congress and ask them to change it., Anita., Q    I have one immigration question and wanted to clarify one thing.  So, I understand that not every adult with a child is going to be prosecuted.  If there are families that are being held together, detained together somewhere, and 20 days goes by, what is going to happen then?  I didn’t get an answer about that last week.  I don’t understand.  The law says you can’t keep them together or keep the children — even with parents — for longer than 20 days.  So then what happens?, SANDERS:  Hopefully, Congress will pass a law and fix the problem., Q    In the next 20 days?, SANDERS:  Well, why should it be so hard?  They all say that they don’t want to separate families.  Seems like it should be pretty simple to me., Q    I said I had a clarification., SANDERS:  Go ahead., Q    So Jeff asked you a question about Congress and the bill.  Were you, in your response, referring to just a standalone bill that deals with family separation?  Or were you referring to the bigger immigration bill that the House is supposed to take up this week?, SANDERS:  Our preference would be a bill that addresses all of the pillars that we’ve laid out that we’d like to see addressed in an immigration package.  And that’s what our focus is right now, is there’s a bill that does that on the table.  If that doesn’t happen, then we’ll talk about other pieces of legislation at that point., Q    So the President still wants that bill to go forward even though he said they don’t want to — they shouldn’t waste their time?, SANDERS:  Look, Democrats in the Senate have made clear they’re not going to support this.  And because we need at least some Democrats to get on board, they’ve made it very clear that they don’t want to work with the President, that they don’t want to fix our immigration system; that they’d rather have open borders and rampant crime than work with the President to create solutions., Until they change their mind, we’re going to continue looking at the best ways that we can fix these problems, but we need Congress to help us., John., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  This President is the first in the television age who has yet to address the American public on nationwide television from the Oval Office.  Many Republican consultants have said he might have a stronger hand in influencing Congress if he made a nationally televised address on immigration and what changes he’d like to see, to explain it.  Is that something that’s on the table within the administration?, ...]

       "298  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 3:00 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Yesterday, momentum continued to build behind our plan to deliver massive tax relief and job creation for the American people.  The House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the Senate Finance Committee passed its companion tax reform bill.  These were important moments as we move closer to a final vote., In recent months, we’ve heard from American entrepreneurs, workers, and families from every corner of our nation about how this plan will empower them to build a better life., In Pennsylvania, Susie Schlomann said that our plan will be “incredible for me and other fixed-income retirees,” because tax relief is targeted at the middle class., In Ohio, Kristina Port — a small business owner who raised twins as a single mother while launching her company — said the increase in the child tax credit would help working mothers.  She also said simplifying the complex tax code would ease the burden on entrepreneurs and allow them to devote more of their time to growing their business, rather than wrestling with their taxes., In state after state, story after story, we’ve heard how our plan will profoundly improve the lives of hardworking Americans.  The optimism is coming back, because with this tax plan — combined with the President’s efforts to eliminate job-killing regulations — Americans feel like their goals are once again attainable., It’s a reminder of one of the things that made our country unique to begin with.  Our people have always been able to visualize a future for themselves and their children and make it a reality.  That’s why it’s called the “American Dream,” and this tax plan will make it more attainable for more of our people than ever before., But for this to happen, we need economic growth that makes it possible for businesses to create jobs and raise wages.  So to give some perspective on how our tax plan is going to do that, I’ve invited Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to join us in the briefing today.  Kevin will say a few words and then take some questions specific to this topic.  And, as always, I will come back up to take the rest of your questions after that, which I’m sure will all be on tax reform.  (Laughter.), So, with that, I’ll turn it over to Kevin., MR. HASSETT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Thanks.  And it’s a pleasure to be here to see so many familiar faces.  You know, last week I had the honor of chairing the Economic Policy Committee meeting at the OECD in Paris.  And the Economic Policy Committee is one of the oldest committees in OECD, and it brings together people, like the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, from countries around the OECD., And, at the meeting, they were going through the staff recommendations of the OECD for creating economic growth in countries around the world.  And the three main points of the staff recommendations were tax reform, infrastructure, and deregulation — that if the government pursues those things, then they can produce more economic growth., In fact, there was widespread acclaim for the President’s approach towards corporate taxation in particular, because the OECD has been calling for us to reform our corporate tax code for almost a decade., And so the idea right now that this corporate tax reform is close to the finish line is celebrated not only by us at the White House, but by people around the world who have recognized that us having a non-competitive tax code, the highest corporate tax on Earth, a worldwide system that rewards companies for locating activity elsewhere, is bad not only for us but for the world economy — because a vibrant U.S. economy is good even for our friends in the OECD., And, with that, I’m pleased to see that the House Ways and Means Committee and then the House have passed this bill, and that it’s out of the Finance Committee — I look forward to the Senate moving forward right after the Thanksgiving break., And, I guess, I promised — I’m not good at this.  I don’t know what the protocol is, but I’ll start in the front row and then work back., Q    Perfect.  (Laughter.), MR. HASSETT:  Yeah, that’s right.  I’m just an economist., Q    Kevin, I know you’re an economist but there’s obviously a political component to all of this.  You got at least six senators up on the Hill, including Ron Johnson, saying that they can’t support the bill in its current form or they have serious concerns about it.  You can only afford to lose two.  Are you confident that you can get this passed through the Senate?  Or could the President run into another situation, like he did with Obamacare?  That he wins the House and then loses everything in the Senate., MR. HASSETT:  Look, there’s an old joke about economists, that there are three types:  those who can count and those who can’t.  (Laughter.)  And it takes a while for that one to sink in.  And the fact is that the President has supported, from the beginning, regular order because he doesn’t think that we have to wait until the thing becomes law to learn what’s in it; that the right thing to do is to expose the bills to scrutiny and debate., And Senator Johnson — I met with him yesterday in his office — has some serious concerns, and it’s appropriate at this point in legislative process to bring those forward.  And I’m hopeful that people can work it out and that everybody, even Democrats, will end up wanting to vote for it., And so I’m not sure about the etiquette for follow-ups, so I’ll try to limit people to one because there’s a lot of hands., Q    What makes you think trickle-down economics is going to work this time when it hasn’t worked before?, MR. HASSETT:  So trickle-down economics is something that, I guess, people who criticize the idea that taxes affect the economy will use to characterize approaches like the one that we’re pursuing.  But I don’t think the idea that’s celebrated by even the non-partisan staff of the OECD — that if you have lower marginal rates, you get economic growth — is voodoo economics or controversial at all., And yeah, the fact is that countries around the world have cut their corporate rates and had broad-based reforms, like we’re doing on the individual side, and then seeing economic growth result., I don’t think there’s anybody who thinks that you’ll get no growth or negative growth for this.  Maybe there are a few people.  But in every economic model I’ve seen, you get growth — either a lot of growth, or sometimes if it’s a closed economy model, a little growth.  But you get positive growth out of this.  And that growth will benefit workers, and let’s talk about that., So, right now, the way a U.S. firm avoids U.S. tax is they locate activity, say, in a country like Ireland instead of here.  And so if you build a plant in Ireland, then you can sell the stuff back into the U.S.  And when you sell the stuff back into the U.S., then it increase the trade deficit and doesn’t do anything for American workers, but it does increase the demand for Irish workers and drive up their wages., And so what the President wants to do is cut the rate to 20 percent and build guardrails around the tax code so that people can’t transfer price — everything to Ireland anymore.  And if we do that, then the people who benefit will be the workers here in the U.S. who have increased demand for their jobs., Q    And the incentive —, MR. HASSETT:  I said no follow-ups.  So I’m going to back this way and then I’m going to switch sides.  I’m sorry I don’t know everybody’s names here., Q    One of Senator Johnson’s concerns is that this bill does not do enough for medium-sized and small businesses.  Can you talk about what the bill does do for medium-size and small businesses?, MR. HASSETT:  Sure.  And the fact is that I want to remind everybody that the President has, really, three main non-negotiables for this bill:  that there is a 20 percent corporate tax rate; that there’s a big middle-class tax cut; and that the bill simplified the tax code.  And we believe, after analyzing the progress on the Hill, that both approaches satisfy the three main objectives., And so the question then is, moving forward, what do they do about pass-through entities?  What do they do about this, what do they do about that?  And we at the White House don’t want to get ahead of that process., The President supports regular order because that’s really how deals get made and how bills become law.  The fact is, it’s urgent that we get a 20 percent rate for America’s workers.  And it’s urgent that we get a middle-class tax cut for America’s workers.  And the details about like exactly when the small business things kick in and out are things that we’re watching them work out up on the Hill.  And we encourage them to pursue regular order because they need to listen to everybody and get the votes they need to make this law., I’ll go to the lady, right there., Q    One of the major differences between the House and the Senate bill is the elimination of the non-taxable tuition waivers.  So while they’re trying to reconcile their differences on that tax reform bill, what do you foresee which could potentially move this tax burden to a lot of young Americans?, MR. HASSETT:  That’s the kind of detail that we’re letting Congress work out.  The fact is that they’re finding the coalitions that they need to pass the bills in the House and the Senate.  And we support that process.  We support regular order.  We support the transparency that leading debate about issues like this., Sorry, now I said I’d come over here.  Yeah., Q    Kevin, thanks for being here.  On one of your TV appearances yesterday, you said that an average family, when this is all said and done, could accumulate a savings benefit of $4,000.  That’s a lot of money., MR. HASSETT:  That’s a lot of money., Q    Can you walk us through that?, MR. HASSETT:  Sure.  And for those of you — and I see some nerdy-looking people out there, so I’m sure that there’s people that want to do this — (laughter) — that we’ve got two CEA reports that go through this in gory detail.  And the fact is that you can get to numbers like that four different ways., I won’t try to do that now in the limited time that we have, but the basic idea is that back when we increased our corporate tax rate from 34 to 35 percent, we were kind of in the middle of the pack of OECD nations.  Subsequently, what happened was that countries around the world found that when they cut the corporate tax, that their economic activity increased and the welfare of their workers improved.  And then they very often did it again., A typical country, since our tax increase, has cut its corporate rate two or maybe even three times.  And for economists, what that does is it gives us an enormous amount of data to analyze because there are countries that change their rate and countries that don’t.  And you can compare the experiences of those two types of countries., There’s a big peer-review literature that looks at that, including a paper that’s by a German economist — that’s about to come out in the American Economic Review.  And what we do is we go through all those papers and we have charts that show, well, if this paper is true, what wage effect do you get.  And most of the action is well north of $4,000.  And that’s where the number comes from., I’ll go in the middle, with the orange tie., Q    One of the criticisms, Kevin, of the tax reform proposal is that the corporate tax rate is cut permanently.  The individual tax rate phases out after 10 years.  Why, in your view, is that such a good idea?, MR. HASSETT:  So the President supports permanent tax cuts for the middle class and permanent tax cuts for corporations.  And that’s certainly the objective of the planners of this tax bill.  But there are also Senate budget rules and reconciliation rules that are required to allow this bill to move forward with 51 votes., Of course, the hope for everybody is that when the time comes for these things to expire, that they get extended, as happens — I might add — even for the top marginal rate when President Obama came into office.  And so they extended most of the Bush tax cuts.  But even the top rate, at the beginning — which interestingly they must have done because they knew that if you were to increase the top marginal tax rate during a recession, that it would be very harmful for the economy., So, back then, there was bipartisan support for the idea that you should not lift the top marginal rate.  And so there should be bipartisan support.  There would be economic growth effects of bringing it down right now., I’ll go back down into the middle there., Q    Hi, Emma Robinson, One America News.  The two bills are different in that the House bill repeals or does away with the estate tax and the Senate doesn’t.  And I know that was a big point for the administration, and Vice President Pence has voiced his support for repealing the death tax, as they call it.  What are your thoughts on that?  And do you think a final bill will include a repeal of it?, MR. HASSERTT:  I think that — again, that’s one of the things that the Senate and the House are working out.  I know that the President very strongly favors the elimination of the death tax.  And if that is in the final bill, I’m sure that he’ll be happy about that.  But he’s listed his non-negotiables, and those non-negotiables I cited at the beginning., I’ll go back to the far back now., Q    Thank you, Kevin.  I appreciate it.  Can you talk about this moment earlier in the week at the Wall Street Journal event?  Gary Cohn was on stage, and the moderator asked a group of CEOs, “If tax reform passes, who here is going to increase their investment?”  And only a couple of hands went up in the room.  Gary Cohn said, why aren’t there more hands going up?, Can you answer that question?  Why aren’t there more hands going up in a room like that?  You would assume that CEOs would say, yes, in fact, we are going to invest more if tax reform passes.  Is the administration missing something there?, MR. HASSETT:  So that’s a great question.  And I went on a little bit after Gary Cohn, and when they asked that question, it was kind of hard for me because, like here, they are really bright lights, but even brighter there, and so I couldn’t quite see how many hands there were.  But when I was there, it looked like maybe about half the hands went up.  And I think if you go back and look, that it could be that people had time to think about it., But as an economist, if I go back and look at the academic literature, very often people survey CFOs, and they say, hey, if we change the tax code, would you guys do anything?  And they tend to always answer “no” in surveys.  But if you look at the hard evidence about what they do, imagine if they didn’t respond to taxes, then they wouldn’t be pursuing their fiduciary duty to maximize profits for their shareholders.  So it would be totally irrational for them to do that.  And firms that did act rationally in response to the tax code would put them out of business by taking advantage of the tax code., So the point is — the hard evidence is that people do respond.  In fact, one of my very, very first papers that I ever wrote when I got out of grad school is the Brookings papers where we looked at the 1986 tax act, the changes that it made to the business tax code and how it affected investment.  And there were very large effects., Right here in the front., Q    Yes, yes.  Gene Sperling, who was once in your position in another administration, says that this tax plan — be it historic — costs $1.5 trillion and it’s a deficit hole.  And he says that basically — this is in a tweet.  I’m just paraphrasing his tweet.  He says, it basically doesn’t justify that cost for 100 million households for a tax increase., MR. HASSETT:  Well, I respect Gene a great deal and consider him a friend, and I disagree with him about that.  And I’m sure we’ll at some point have a chance to talk about that., But here’s the way I think about it and what I would say to Gene if he was here:  That if you look at the Joint Tax Committee’s score, in the 10th year they say that the tax bill costs about $170 billion.  If you look at the CBO projection of GDP, then in the 10th year GDP is about $28 trillion.  And so the amount of deficit that you’re talking relative to GDP in the 10th year is only 0.6 percent.  It doesn’t take a heck of a lot of economic growth to cover that hole by the 10th year., And so the idea that right now we have the highest corporate tax on Earth generating almost no revenue — because people avoid the tax by moving factories to Ireland — that if we fix that, if we repair it and make the U.S. an attractive place again, that it’s going to blow a hole in the deficit — it’s just not economically rational., And I know that the Joint Tax Committee score says what it says, and I respect the professionals in that staff, but the fact is that the OECD has a study, which we’d be happy to email you, that says that the U.S. in the corporate tax space is on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve; that we’ve got such a high corporate tax rate that we’re chasing business offshore and losing revenue., And so the idea that this blows a hole in the deficit I think is just incorrect., I’ll go to the purple tie., Q    I want to pick up where John, right in front of me, left off when he asked about the phase-out on the individual side.  You’re an economist; however, the two answers that you gave were both political.  One, there’s reconciliation rules.  And two, hopefully politicians down the line solve it.  But like I mentioned, you’re an economist.  So can you not make an economic argument as to why this is good economically for people?, MR. HASSETT:  Oh, is it good for things to expire?, Q    Correct.  Is there an economic argument as to why this is good for the country as it stands right now to expire within eight years or so?, MR. HASSETT:  If you lower marginal tax rates, broaden the base, lower rates, give the middle class a tax cut, if you cut the corporate rate — if you do any of those things, they’re positive for economic growth.  And they’re less positive for growth if they expire., Expensing is kind of a strange thing in the sense that if you have expensing for a year, if you go back and look at U.S. history, very often in recessions, they’ll put in expensing for a year to try to stimulate the economy.  When expensing expires, it could actually have a short-run stimulus because people try to buy capital before the thing goes away., But for the most part, permanent tax cuts are far more impactful than things that expire — which is why if you go back and look at the Obama administration, when they were here during the beginning of the Great Recession, they even extended the Bush tax cuts at the top because they understood this., Can I go right here?  And then I’ll come to you, and then that might be the last question because Sarah is standing., Q    I actually want to follow up on that, though.  You all made a value judgment to make the corporate tax cuts permanent and to make the individual tax cuts expire, even though you want all of them to be permanent.  What’s the rationale for having corporations have that certainty of knowing that they don’t have to worry about what’s going to happen in Washington while families are going to have to worry about what politicians do six, seven years now?, MR. HASSETT:  Sure.  Well, those are the kind of things that are being worked out by Congress in order to create a bill that under Senate and House rules can become law.  And the non-negotiables for us are both met in both bills, and we consider that good news.  But the choices that the Senate has to make in order to acquire a coalition to make this law are choices that the Senate has to make.  And we don’t want to get in front of that process., Q    You don’t see the value one way or the other, whether the corporate tax cuts versus —, MR. HASSETT:  I think tax cuts that are permanent, of course, will have large positive effects., I’ll give you the last., Q    Kevin, you’ve melded politics and economics here quite successfully, and I want to ask you a political and economic question.  You’ve talked about growth covering what the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee say could be a deficit hole, a deficit implication of $1.5 trillion.  That is going to be measurable over time.  There’s going to be a means by which either dynamic scoring or static scoring answers that question., And since it’s on the mind of some of your undecided Republican senators, is this administration willing to commit to a review five years in to see if the growth models have held along your lines and the deficit implications aren’t as large — or, if they aren’t, to reassess these tax cuts in order not to blow a hole in the deficit?, MR. HASSETT:  You know, I have not discussed with the President, and I don’t think Sarah has, what we’re willing to commit to in terms of what we do five years from now.  But I can tell you —, Q    Do you think there would be —, MR. HASSETT:  But let me talk about what we can be clear about today, which is that, as the President came into office, the President’s opponents were saying that 2 percent growth was inevitable, that we were stuck in a secular stagnation; that the President’s policies couldn’t deliver 3 percent growth, and that it was a cockamamie idea to assert it., We’ve had two quarters in a row of 3 percent growth.  If you look at the fourth quarter data, it’s suggesting — at the Atlanta Fed, they have GDPNow, which is about 3.2 as of yesterday.  So it’s saying that we’re growing at 3 percent.  If we take that momentum into next year and add a tax cut, then we’re quite confident that one should be able to expect sustained growth at that level or above., With that, I think I have to hand it back to Sarah.  Thank you so much for being so gracious with your questions., MS. SANDERS:  Thank you, Kevin.  Major, he’s right, I haven’t spoken to the President about that.  But I do appreciate that you know that the President will still be here in five years.  So, I like that vote of confidence that you would know that we will be here to take that review, and we’ll be sure to raise that with him., Let me go back here., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  I have a non-Roy Moore question for you.  Can you say definitively — I want to ask you about Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri.  Can you say definitively, from this podium, that he has not been held hostage by the Saudis?  And does the President plan to speak to Prime Minister Hariri at all?, MS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware of any anticipated conversations.  That’s something I’d have to check on and get back to you.  And I don’t have any further comment beyond that at this point right now.  And I would refer you to the State Department on specifics of that., Cecilia., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  If it’s fair to investigate Al Franken and the allegation made by his accuser, is it also fair to investigate this President and the allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by more than a dozen women?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think that this was covered pretty extensively during the campaign.  We addressed that then.  The American people, I think, spoke very loud and clear when they elected this President., Q    But how is this different?, MS. SANDERS:  I think in one case, specifically, Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing, and the President hasn’t.  I think that’s a very clear distinction., Major., Q    So I want to revisit something we discussed yesterday.  You said, one of the ways that Alabama voters might be able to figure out if these allegations against Roy Moore are true is in the court of law.  That’s a direct quote from you.  There’s no criminal means by which that could happen.  So are you suggesting that Roy Moore sue the accusers in order to hash this out in court?, MS. SANDERS:  That would be something that I would refer to him to make that decision.  That’s not something I would be able to advise on., Q    But that’s the venue you meant when you talked about “in the court of law.”, MS. SANDERS:  I said that’s one option, one way to determine that process.  But that would be a decision that he would have to make, certainly not one I’m going to make., ...]

EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)  What a group.  What a group.  Thank you.  (Applause.), Thank you very much.  And I have to say, I don’t know if you know, you broke the all-time record.  Last year was your record, and I was here too.  (Laughter.)  And the year before that, you didn’t do so well, and I wasn’t here.  (Laughter.)  You went from $18 million, which is good — not great — to $30 million last year.  And this year — and I think that was some kind of an all-time record, by the way.  So you have to be proud.  But this year we did $32 million.  So that’s quite a record.  (Applause.), And it really is wonderful to be here with so many friends and colleagues, and really true and great American patriots., I want to begin by thanking our incredible House leadership team, Speaker Paul Ryan.  Paul, thank you.  Thank you, Paul.  (Applause.), A wonderful man who I’ve gotten to know very well — what a personality — Kevin McCarthy.  Where’s Kevin?  Where is — stand up, Kevin.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Kevin., A man who’s got more courage than all of us, Steve Scalise.  (Applause.)  Steve.  You don’t have to stand.  Look at him.  Kevin, he got up faster than you did.  I don’t know what’s — (laughter)., Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Cathy.  Cathy.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Great job, Cathy., NRCC Chair Steve Stivers — a general.  I didn’t even know about that.  I’m impressed.  (Applause.)  I don’t know if I like that or your political career better, but they’re both very good.  Thank you, General., And tonight’s dinner chair, Congressman Tom Emmer.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Great job.  $32 million — I guess you did a good job.  (Laughs.)  We did it together.  (Laughter.)  He was so generous.  He said, “You did it.”  Nope, we did it together.  That’s the way we’re working, right?  It’s the way we’re — thank you very much, Tom., Our Republican majority is one of the most successful in the history of the United States Congress.  Now, we must work to keep our majority so we can keep up the fight for American workers, American security, and the American values enshrined in our glorious Constitution and in our great American flag.  (Applause.), This year, in this election, we are fighting to win, and we are going to win.  Just no reason why we shouldn’t win with what we’ve done over the last year.  No reason whatsoever., We love our country.  We cherish our liberty.  And we always put America first.  If you notice, we’re doing that on trade.  We’re doing that on a lot of things.  (Applause.)  America first.  It’s about time.  It’s about time., Our agenda is already exceeding our highest expectations.  We’ve actually accomplished more than we said we would, and that’s been a long time since you’ve heard that.  We’ve accomplished a lot more.  They said it the other night, that Donald Trump actually has accomplished more than he said he would.  So that’s a good feeling.  And it wasn’t even a friend that said that the other night, which is really a good feeling., We’ve created more than 3 million new jobs since the election.  And if we would have said that number prior to the election, nobody would have believed it possible.  Jobless claims are at — think of it — jobless claims are at a nearly 50-year low.  Fifty years.  (Applause.)  That’s an amazing statistic., African American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded.  (Applause.)  And I have to tell you, the fake news about two weeks ago got me on that one.  Because, two months ago, it was the lowest level ever recorded.  Then, about four weeks ago, it went slightly not as good.  And I made a speech; I said, “African American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded.”  And it really wasn’t.  It was good, but it wasn’t.  And they got me.  They said it wasn’t so., But then, here’s what happened.  Last week, it went back down to the lowest levels ever recorded.  So we have it.  (Laughter and applause.)  So we have it, right?  It makes us feel good.  That’s an important one.  And here’s another one: Hispanic American unemployment has also reached historic lows — lowest ever recorded.  (Applause.)  And women: The lowest levels in 18 years.  (Applause.), Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, and I’ve been talking on the campaign trail for so long that wages have been stagnant for 18, 20, and even 21 years., Confidence is the highest in history.  In the history of our country, confidence for manufacturers is the highest.  (Applause.)  And you see it: Companies are moving back.  Chrysler is moving back to Michigan from Mexico.  You look at so many different companies.  Foxconn, they make a lot of the Apple products.  Great products.  They’re moving to Wisconsin., We have massive companies moving back in.  They all want to be back in.  American producers in the mining, construction, and manufacturing industries gained more jobs in February than in any month in nearly 20 years.  Think of that.  (Applause.), I mean, do you ever hear numbers like this?  And these are really numbers that we’re getting right out of the manual.  This is it.  It’s hard to believe.  These are incredible numbers.  That’s why we should do great when we run in a very short period of time., The economy is booming, and it’s booming because we passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history.  (Applause.)  Biggest in American history., And when they came to me — because not since Ronald Reagan has anything been close — and when they came to me, they said, “We’re going to pass tax reform.”  I said, “Why hasn’t it been done in 38 years?”  They said, “We don’t know, you just can’t do it.”  And I said, “Well, it doesn’t make sense.  You’re cutting taxes. Why?”  “Well, sir, I don’t know, but here’s the bill.  It’s tax reform.  It says tax reform.”, And I said, “There’s something wrong.  How come it hasn’t happened?”  And I said, “You know, I think I have the idea.  Don’t call it tax reform.  Call it tax cuts.”  It was never called tax cuts.  And they said, “Well, what is that?”  I said, “Tax reform might mean you’re reforming taxes and you’re going to raise taxes.  Nobody knows what it means.  So call it tax cuts.  And in fact, let’s call it the Tax Cut, Cut, Cut bill.”  (Laughter.), And Paul Ryan wouldn’t do it.  You know, he’s a classy guy.  He said, “That’s just — I can’t do it.”  (Laughter.)  So we called it the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  And that’s fine, right?  (Applause.), And I see Kevin Brady here someplace.  Where’s Kevin?  Stand up, Kevin, please.  (Applause.)  He doesn’t stop.  And let’s not tell anybody, although you have a lot of cameras back there, actually.  Let’s not tell anybody, Kevin, about phase two that we’ve already started on, right?  Phase two tax cuts.  Right?  (Inaudible.)  (Applause.)  Thank you, Kevin., More than 6 million Americans have already received a tax cut bonus or a pay raise, and that is just the beginning.  I want to thank everyone who made this incredible victory possible, including so many friends that worked with Kevin and myself, people in Congress, great senators, great congresspeople.  You are really incredible, so enjoy it because we’re going to start, probably, on Monday, with Kevin and myself and everybody on doing it again., And I just want to thank you.  And on behalf of Paul, and Kevin, and my other Kevin, my — I don’t know, I think Brady, maybe, is better looking than Kevin.  I don’t know.  (Laughter.), But we really are.  We really — I have to thank the people in this room because you really made it possible.  And you worked hard, and you just wouldn’t stop, and you wouldn’t take no for an answer.  A lot of obstacles.  You wouldn’t take no for an answer., But while Republicans were fighting to reduce taxes for hardworking Americans, the Democrats were fighting to increase taxes.  That’s what they want to do.  They’re actually working right now to increase taxes.  And I’m saying, “How do you lose to that?”  (Laughter.)  They want to increase taxes.  Maybe they’ll call that tax reform.  (Laughter.), Every single Democrat in Congress opposed our middle class tax cuts.  And if Democrats were to gain control of the House, the first thing they would do is raise your taxes.  They would raise your taxes.  They would take away what we’ve done and raise your taxes.  And actually, I’ve seen some of the numbers — very substantially raise your taxes., Republicans also repealed one of the nation’s cruelest and most unfair taxes ever: the Obamacare individual mandate.  (Applause.), And the mandate is gone forever.  And that’s a beauty.  You pay a lot of money not to have to pay and not to get healthcare.  So you’re paying not to have healthcare.  I mean, that wasn’t so good.  But we got rid of it., And you know, included — that nobody even talks about — is ANWR in Alaska, one of the great sites of energy in the world.  And I didn’t think it was a big deal.  And then one day, a friend of mine who was in the oil business called.  “Is it true that you have ANWR in the bill?”  I said, “I don’t know.  Who cares?  What is that?”  (Laughter.)  “What does that mean?”, They said, “No, is it true?”  I said, “What does it mean?  What’s the big deal that they did put it in?”  He said, “Well, you know, Reagan tried, every single President tried, and not one President was successful in getting it.  The Bushes weren’t — everybody.”, I said, “You got to be kidding?  I love it now.”  And after that we fought like hell to get ANWR.  (Laughter.)  He talked me into it — (applause) — and he didn’t care, but he said it was amazing., So by itself, that would have been a big bill.  But that was included.  And we’re doing great, by the way, on energy.  We are now an exporter of energy.  Can you believe that?  (Applause.)  Ten million barrels, folks.  We just cracked ten million barrels., We’ve also ended the crushing onslaught of federal and other regulation.  That’s a big deal.  (Applause.)  And I hate to say it to Kevin, but some people consider what we’ve done on regulation as important and some even more important than the tremendous tax cuts because the regulations were killing our country.  They were killing us.  (Applause.), Together, we have set a record for cutting the red tape — passing a record number of bills to permanently remove job-killing regulations.  All over the country, they’re building now where they had no chance of getting going., Even if you look at the pipelines — immediately upon taking office, I let the pipelines go — Keystone, you know, both of them.  And we let them proceed.  Forty-eight thousand jobs, and we’re going to have two great, environmentally friendly pipelines.  Really great.  Forty-eight thousand jobs.  That was an easy one.  But they would have never been built., We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.  (Applause.), And thanks to this Republican Congress, we’re transforming the VA to keep America’s promise to our brave, incredible, beautiful veterans.  (Applause.), And I want to thank Chairman Phil Roe.  Our Republican majorities sent me legislation that has been incredible — really incredible.  You know, we have VA accountability.  They’ve been trying to get this for 30 years — accountability.  Sounds easy.  But VA accountability, and we got it passed.  That means that people that are very bad — they’re bad in many ways; they’re even sadistic.  You couldn’t fire people from the VA.  Now, you look at them, they do a bad job, they do something wrong, they hurt our veterans — we look at them, and we say, “Jim, you’re fired.  Get the hell out of here.”  (Applause.)  I made a lot of money with that phrase.  That was a great one.  (Laughter.), But Congressman Roe, where are you?  Congressman Roe.  Congressman, thank you, great job.  Great job.  Thank you.  It’s really moving along.  And choice is coming.  Choice — where the veterans can actually — instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks, they can actually go and see a doctor and have it taken care of, and we pay.  (Applause.)  And that’s going to be the big one.  Do you agree with that, Phil?, Because of Republican leadership that all of you helped make possible, America is safer and America is much stronger.  Our military is now better funded, better equipped, and better prepared to defeat any foe that dares to threaten our country or our people., America is being respected again on the world stage.  We’re rebuilding our very depleted military — $700 billion.  And next year, $716 billion.  (Applause.)  We had to do it.  And obviously, defense is number one, but you know what else it is?  Jobs.  Lots of jobs, because we build our equipment.  So it’s lots of jobs., For the last eight years, Democrats apologized for America.  Republicans, on the other hand, are standing up for America.  (Applause.)  Right?  We’ve seen a lot of apologies.  Last eight years, we’ve seen a lot of apologizing.  Not any longer.  We don’t apologize.  (Applause.)  Took a little while to figure that one out., It has been an incredible year for our country and for the Republican Party.  And the accomplishments of our party in Congress are even more impressive because Democrats have stood in the way of progress every single day., Do you know, we have hundreds of people that cannot come into the administration because they’re being slow-walked by the Democrats in the Senate?  Last count, it was 270 people.  Now the only thing good about that — in the private sector they would like it.  They would say we’re cutting payroll., But here, we want to get them — in the State Department.  And one of your originals, Mike Pompeo, will be, hopefully, very soon, our new Secretary of State.  (Applause.)  He’s going to do a great job.  Mike is going to do a great job., Not only did Democrats universally oppose tax cuts, but every single Democrat voted no on better healthcare.  They voted no.  Every single one.  The one thing they do great is obstruct.  They’re great at obstruction.  They’re wonderful at sticking in a bloc.  They rarely break up, although I think we’re going to break them up a little bit because a lot of them are saying nice things about me in certain states that we won by a lot, and they’re running in races.  You know about that, right?, But they really are a bloc.  They just vote no.  And I don’t think people want that when it comes time to elect.  They don’t want to fix our healthcare system.  They don’t want DACA.  They do not want DACA because they think it might be a good political issue, and we want DACA.  And DACA is very much tied to the wall, and we have to have the wall.  For the drugs that are pouring into our country, and for the people that we don’t want in our country, we’re going to have the wall.  (Applause.), But they don’t want DACA.  They really don’t.  They want to use it as a political football.  And guess what?  I think it plays better for us than it does for them because we want to do something for the 800,000, and they don’t.  So it’s been a little bit of change of position, and we’re going to win that one every time.  But we’re also getting the wall., Nearly every Democrat voted against a ban on late-term abortion, when unborn babies can feel the pain.  The late-term abortion ban is commonsense policy, supported by almost two-thirds of the American people.  But virtually every Democrat voted in lockstep against protecting these innocent lives., On issue after issue, House Democrats are way outside of the American mainstream.  Nowhere in the Democrats’ extremism — and nowhere can you see anything displayed more clearly than on immigration.  A vote for House Democrats is truly a vote for open borders — people pouring into our country, pouring in.  We have no idea who they are.  They’re coming in — open borders.  You look at sanctuary cities, where criminals are protected., If House Democrats control the committees and control the floor, they will block every single effort to secure our borders and to defend our communities., Nearly every House Democrat voted in favor of sanctuary cities.  They voted to release criminal aliens to prey on innocent American lives.  Republicans believe our cities should be safe havens for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens or illegal immigrants.  (Applause.), It’s time for Congress to stop funding sanctuary cities so we can restore the rule of law.  (Applause.)  The American people are with us.  Let’s fight to save those incredible American lives.  And you see what’s happening.  You see the slaughter.  You see the kind of killing and hurt and pain.  And we are fighting very hard, and I think we’re doing one hell of a job.  And you look at our borders, and you see the difference in the numbers.  But the laws are not helping us, because we have some laws that are very much against everything that we stand for in this room., House Democrats also voted against Kate’s Law -– a commonsense bill authored by Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  Where’s Bob?  Bob.  (Applause.)  Bob.  Thank you, Bob.  And that bill has been sitting for a long time over there, Bob, hasn’t it?  It’s too bad., They voted against legislation to keep gang members like MS-13 out of our country.  These are extreme and dangerous positions.  They make no sense., So here is our message from the coming election to the American people: If the Democrats ever got back into power, they would vote to raise your taxes; release dangerous criminals; open your borders; shut down this great surge of American energy that is tremendous for jobs, tremendous for the economic wellbeing of our country, and, frankly, helping the world.  They would take over American healthcare; take away your Second Amendment; and ship away your jobs to other countries, like has gone on for so many years.  And those days are over.  Those days are over.  (Applause.), The world, including our friends, has been taking advantage of the United States of America.  We can’t allow that to happen anymore.  We just can’t.  We want our jobs to be here.  We want our great factories, our great plants to be here.  We don’t want people fired and watch a company leave our country, make a product somewhere nearby, ship it back into our country, not be taxed, and all we get out of it is unemployment and pain.  Not going to happen anymore.  That’s why so many companies are moving back.  (Applause.)  They’re moving back.  First time in many, many decades., That’s why we need strong Republican majorities.  (Applause.)  It doesn’t matter what Democrat candidates say on the campaign trail because once Democrats get to Washington, they always do the same thing: They vote for the liberal Pelosi agenda down the line, straight down the line every single time.  They will never vote for us.  They will never vote for what’s right., These days, there’s no such thing as a Blue Dog Democrat, a Red State Democrat, or a Conservative Democrat because they are all Pelosi Democrats: weak on crime, weak on terrorism, and weak on national defense.  (Applause.), And on terrorism, in Iraq and Syria, we’ve taken back almost 100 percent, in a very short period of time, of the land that they took.  And it all took place since our election.  We’ve taken back close to 100 percent., Democrats like to campaign as moderates, but they always govern like radicals.  That is why I am going to campaign all across this country to elect Republicans so that we can reduce taxes further; reduce crime; increase jobs; and make our communities safe, and prosperous, and secure., And I’ll be all over the country.  Kevin, you’ll get me all over.  Where is our Kevin?  You’re going to get me all over the country, Kevin?  (Applause.)  And I’ll be complaining every single trip.  (Laughter.)  But I’m going to get there., We are going to keep criminals off our streets and terrorists — we’re going to keep them the hell out of our country.  (Applause.), Our opponents are fielding the most candidates they’ve ever had in a quarter century.  Many have not held office before, which means it will be easier for them to conceal their true beliefs.  You’re not going to know anything about these people., That’s why we must tell the truth over and over again: A vote for a House Democrat is a vote for higher taxes, open borders, and the destruction of American jobs and American wealth.  It’s also the destruction of the American Dream.  It’s a dream, and they’re destroying that beautiful dream., But to win, we have to out-work the opposition.  For some reason, when a party wins the presidency — incredible — what happens is they lose two years later.  And I know what happens, I figured — you know, I could never understand — like, 95 percent of the time they end up losing the midterms.  It’s called complacency., Nobody has explained it.  I couldn’t understand why — you win the presidency, you think it’d — and we do record business.  The economy is maybe the best it’s ever been ever, I think — ever.  How has it ever been better?  (Applause.), The stock market is at an all-time high, jobs are the number one — 154 million jobs.  That is the most jobs in the history of our country.  We have, right now, the most jobs.  (Applause.), We need more people, if you can believe it.  We’re going to have an incredible expansion.  But it’s called complacency.  Because you win the presidency, you work so hard.  Look how hard we worked.  You work, you work, you work, and you win.  And now you take it easy a little bit.  “Oh, I’m so happy we won.  That was so hard.”  And then a year goes by, and now, all of the sudden, you’re running again.  And you get complacent, and you lose., But then what happens — oh, boy, are we going to — are we going to win 2020.  But we have to worry about ’18 before we worry about ’20.  (Applause.)  But there is a complacency, and I can understand it.  It’s natural — human trait.  But we cannot be complacent.  We can’t.  We have so much to gain, and this country has so much to lose., So we have to remember — you know, we have a short period of time now.  We have to remember., And the other thing is, you know, we had five races up until last week.  And of the five races, we won all five.  These people back here expected us to lose a couple of those races, maybe more than that.  We won.  They didn’t know what to do., So they said, “We didn’t win by as much as we were supposed to.”  And, by the way, if we won by more, they would’ve found a reason.  So we’re fighting the press, we’re fighting the media; we always will, for whatever reason.  But we’re 5 and 0, and then we lost by 300 votes the other night, right?  Three-hundred out of two-hundred-and-twenty-some-odd-thousand votes.   Three-hundred votes., And I will tell you, though, that area in Pennsylvania and all of Pennsylvania and all other states — they’re energized because I made a speech there two nights before, and I’ll tell you what — that crowd was — they were going.  They really — they were happy.  They were thrilled.  I wish I was running.  Boy.  (Laughter.)    Man.  That was some energetic group.  And it was close.  It was really close.  We went in there; they were down.  Good man — Rick Saccone.  Good man.  And didn’t quite make it.  But lost — think of it — lost by about 300 votes out of all those votes.  So it’s pretty incredible.  But we can’t let it happen.  We have to win.  There’s nothing like winning.  We have to win., Now, the last election, we defied every expectation and totally proved the pundits wrong.  Right?  They said, “There’s no way to 270.”  Remember that?  (Applause.)  “There is no way to 270.”  And everybody believed them.   I even believed them.   I said, you know, it doesn’t look good.  I heard this for six months.  “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.”  I kept hearing that, right?  (Applause.)  And I said, “I think I’m doing well, but they’re showing me a little down in Ohio.”  And I said, “Man, I guess you can’t win if you can’t win Ohio.”  So I went to Ohio — we have great people.  Those are great people.  Now, we really won Ohio by a lot, right?  (Applause.)  We won Ohio by a lot.  And we won Iowa by a lot., And we ran the East Coast because, you know, we have a tremendous disadvantage in presidential elections with the Electoral College.  Much easier to get the popular vote, but it’s a very much different campaign.  It’s like somebody that trains for the 100-yard dash and trains for the mile.  It’s a much different thing.  But we just ran out the East Coast, and it was a thing of beauty.  But they all said we couldn’t do it.  Now they say the midterms.  Here come the midterms.  And, as usual, they say, “Well, 95 percent of the time it doesn’t happen.”  But nobody has ever had an economy like this.  Nobody has ever had a military that’s getting so much stronger so fast.  Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.  The people in this room have done it.  Nobody has ever done it., We sent a message straight to the media, to the lobbyists, and to the powerbrokers that this city doesn’t belong to you; it belongs to the American people.  That’s what the message was.  (Applause.), Now, I shouldn’t say it to the people in this room — (laughter) — because, you know, a couple of you are a little marginal about this.  But I came up with this expression — it’s called, “Drain the swamp,” right?  Drain the swamp.  And I hated it.  (Applause.)  No, no.  I hated it.  And it was a speech during the campaign, and it was a term that was actually give to me.  Usually, I like to think them up myself, but this was given to me.  Which bothered me, too.  (Laughter.)  I never liked that., But they had this expression, “Drain the swamp,” and I hated it.  I thought it was so hokey.  I said, “That is the hokiest — give me a break.  I’m embarrassed to say it.”  And I was in Florida with 25,000 people going wild, and I said, “And we will drain the swamp.”  The place went crazy.  (Laughter.)   I couldn’t believe it.  And then, the next speech, I said it again.  And they went even crazier.  “We will drain the swamp.”  I hate that, especially these people right here.  (Laughter and Applause).  They’re saying, “Oh, please don’t say this, Mr. President.”  Don’t worry.  Close your ears.  “We will drain the swamp.”  And every time I said it, I’d get the biggest applause.  And after four or five times, I said, “Boy, what a great expression.  I love saying it.  You know?”  (Laughter.)   It’s amazing.  It really is amazing., But this city does belong to loyal, hardworking, taxpaying Americans.  And with your help, with the help of the hard work of everyone in this room — and you do work hard; it’s a tough job.  Politics is nasty.  I used to say, “The toughest people are real estate developers in New York City.”  And now I say, “You guys are babies.”  (Laughter.)  They come to see me, “Hi, Don.”  I say, “You are nothing.”  (Laughter and Applause).  These politicians are brutal.  “We got a leak.  We got a this.  We got a that.  We got a horrible false story on the front page of every newspaper.”  No, no, no.  Real estate developers are no longer the toughest people.  Politicians in Washington are the toughest people.  (Applause.)  Not even — it’s not even close., But we’re going to defy the predictions once again.  We will keep the House majority.  (Applause.)  And we will keep fighting for the change the American people want and they deserve.  The Democrats think they’re invincible.  I mean, I watch this Maxine Waters.  You ever see Maxine Waters?  (Laughter.)   A low-IQ individual.  (Applause.)  Low IQ.  “We will impeach him.  We will impeach him.”  “But he hasn’t done anything wrong.”  “It doesn’t matter.  We will impeach him.”  (Laughter.)   This is what we’re going to have.  This is what we’re going to have to fight against.  It’s easier just keep going good.  We’re going to keep the economy strong., The truth is, the Democrats never have been more vulnerable because they’ve lost touch with normal, everyday working people.  Democrats haven’t learned.  (Applause.)  They still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable., You know, when Hillary made that speech, she said, “deplorable.”  I thought it was bad, but I didn’t know it was going to be that bad.  (Laughter.)  But the problem is, she said so many of my people were deplorable.  And, you know, the next day, I made a speech, and everybody is wearing, “I am deplorable.”  And I said, “There’s something going on here.”  That was not a good word to use.  You have to be careful in politics, right?  That was not a good — and I would say her last statement about women — they have to get approval from their husbands, their sons, and their male bosses to vote for Trump.  That was not a good statement.  (Laughter and applause).  Not good., You notice how fast the Democrats have run from these statements now?  They are disavowing those statements like I’ve never heard before.  “She’s wrong.”  People that were her biggest supporters are now saying, “What is she doing?”  Why doesn’t she just go home?  (Laughter.)   But that was not a good statement., But we know the truth.  And the truth is that we are great patriots.  We really are.  We’re doing what’s right.  We come from every city, from every town, from every walk of life.  We come from backgrounds, and it doesn’t matter the color, the creed.  But we all have one thing in common: We love this country.  We love this country.  (Applause.)  And we’re putting the interests of our country and our people and our taxpayers — we’re putting them first.  This election is not merely about which party is in charge in Congress.  It’s about whether the American people will be in charge of their government., The choice cannot be any clearer.  It’s never been this clear.  It’s never — think of it.  It’s never been this clear.  The Democrats used to be somewhat in the middle, and now they’re so far right — meaning, that’s where they’re going to be.  But the Democrats used to be right here.  And now what happened is they just moved.  They just moved.  They’re going so far to the left-hand side of the equation, I don’t know whether or not it’s going to even be possible for them to do well.  But for some reason, they’ll probably do okay.  We can’t let that happen.  They have gone so far left, we have to go a little bit further right.  We’re doing very, very well, and I think you’re going to have something very, very, special take place in a short period of time.  (Applause.), While congressional Democrats delay, and they obstruct, and they resist, Republicans actually deliver.  There’s never been a group that have delivered like we’ve delivered, especially in the first year of an administration.  We’re creating jobs for everybody — for the African American population.  They’re thanking me.  They’re thanking me.  Hispanic Americans, all Americans.  But they’re really thanking us., While Democrats denigrate our history, Republicans believe young Americans should be taught to have pride in America’s achievements and to treasure our truly incredible heritage.  While Democrats hand over our rights to international organizations, we defend our sovereignty and we defend our Constitution.  And we defend our American flag.  We’re the ones defending it.  (Applause.), And while Democrats sit on their hands, Republicans stand with law enforcement.  (Applause.)  These are great people.  We stand with working families.  And we always proudly stand for our national anthem.  (Applause.), We believe in strong borders and safe communities.  And we believe in the truth of our national motto: In God we trust.  (Applause.), Our victories are Americans’ victories because the Republican Party is now the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American Dream.  (Applause.), Our mission is to serve the needs, the desires, and the highest ambitions of the American people.  And that’s what we’re doing.  And we’re really doing a great job of it.  We work for them.  Their hopes are our hopes.  Their dreams are our dreams.  And their future if what we are fighting for each and every day., With your help, and with our Republican majorities in Congress, we will carry the hopes and dreams of the American people all the way to victory in November.  So important.  So important.  And together, we will build a future of safety, security, prosperity, and freedom for all of our citizens.  We will never give in.  We will never give up.  And we will never, ever stop fighting to make America great again.  And that’s what’s happening.  (Applause.), ...]

       "300  [Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill, \\nWashington, D.C., 7:00 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome.  And thank you to my friend Frank Donatelli for that overly generous introduction., Frank knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is just a little bit shorter.  I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican — in that order.  (Applause.), And I’s a great honor to be here tonight to address the rising generation of conservative leaders, the men and women of Young America’s Foundation, here at the 39th National Conservative Student Conference.  Give yourselves a round of applause.  You’re going to be making a difference in America for a long time.  (Applause.), So welcome back to Washington, D.C.  Before I get started, I bring greetings this evening from a friend of mine, a man who’s fighting every day for common-sense, conservative values — from the very heart of the White House in the Oval Office, I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America — President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), Thanks to the support of so many young conservatives like all of you here today all across this country, last November President Trump won a historic victory.  More counties than any President since Ronald Reagan — 30 of 50 states, states no Republican had carried in a generation.  The truth is with your support, President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red.  (Applause.), And I came here tonight just to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped elect a President who is fighting every day, fighting every day for the values and the ideals that unite us, and fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the American people., And for my part, it’s a privilege to be back at the Young America’s Foundation.  I’ve worked hand-in-hand with YAF going back more than 15 years — not from when that picture was taken.  (Laughter.)  But from when I first arrived in Congress in 2001.  In 2005, my family had the great privilege to visit the Reagan Ranch, where YAF has wonderfully preserved the wisdom and legacy of my second favorite President of the United States, President Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.), I have to tell you as I ran into Ron and Frank backstage, thinking of all the years that we’ve stood together and all the encouragement they’ve been to me as a conservative, I just can’t tell you how genuinely humbling it is for me to think that I’m standing before you today because of their encouragement, and support and because of folks like you all over this country, and because of the confidence and generosity of our new President that I stand before you today as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America.  So on behalf of my family, thank you for the opportunity to serve.  (Applause.), It’s remarkable to think about the Young America’s Foundation’s history and contributions not just to my small life but to the conservative movement itself and to this entire country., Since its founding in 1960, YAF has been a bulwark of American greatness.  You fight for the truths of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  You fight for those timeless principles of “individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional moral values”.  And let there be no doubt because of the work of all of you all across this country, conservative values are winning on campuses and winning the hearts and minds of America one student at a time.  (Applause.), Today, YAF has more than 300 chapters that are active on over 2,000 campuses all across the United States, reaching a stunning 400,000 students every year., You run so many noteworthy projects and programs, but I’d especially like to thank you particularly for your heroic work promoting and standing for freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas on the campuses across this country.  (Applause.), As I said in an address I gave at the University of Notre Dame just a few months ago, we live in a time when free speech and civility are waning on campuses across America, but YAF is committed to change that.  And you’re making a great difference., You’ve speaking out against speech codes, safe spaces, political correctness.  You fight to defend conservative speakers and students who want nothing more than to exercise their First Amendment right to the freedom of speech., And so tonight, I just want to say thank you.  Thank you to the young men and women of Young America’s Foundation for your strong stand for our freedoms, and thank you for all that you do, day-in and day-out to bring the conservative message to the public square.  (Applause.), And I can promise you as you labor, I see it every day, the Young America’s Foundation finally has a friend back in the Oval Office in the White House.  (Applause.), President Donald Trump has been fighting every day for the conservative vision, the conservative values that you and I hold dear., President Trump has given voice I believe to the aspirations and frustrations of the American people like no leader since President Ronald Reagan., And our President has gone right to work putting men and women into a Cabinet and into this administration that have been advancing that agenda with consistency and with courage., I got to tell you I think President Donald Trump has assembled the strongest conservative Cabinet in my lifetime — bar none.  (Applause.)  Think about it.  How about Ambassador Nikki Haley to the United Nations?  (Applause.)  How about Dr. Ben Carson at Housing and Urban Development?  (Applause.)  In fact, I know you’re going to hear from Dr. Carson tonight, and he’s just an incredible member of this Cabinet — right along with others like Secretary of Defense Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis.  (Applause.), You go around that table and people like Betsy DeVos and others, truly it speaks volumes about this President’s commitment to surrounding himself with extraordinary men and women as a part of this administration’s team, and I couldn’t be more proud to be a small part of it., So as I stand before you today, I’m deeply humbled to be able to report to you that not just in assembling this team, but since day one of this administration, this President has been putting conservative principles into practice to strengthen America at home and abroad so that your generation can live in a country that is prosperous, safe, and free and is built on the highest ideals of the American experience.  (Applause.), Just look at what our President has done to get the American economy moving again already.  President Trump I’m pleased to report has actually signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history.  (Applause.)  This President has been unleashing American energy after years of frustration by a liberal administration like when he authorized the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines.  (Applause.)  And begun to roll back the Clean Power Plan.  The truth is under President Donald Trump, the war on coal is over.  (Applause.), And this President has been putting America first, like when he announced that the United States of America officially today notified the United Nations that we are withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.  (Applause.), In a word, President Trump been keeping his promise to make America prosperous again.  Just this morning, the news came in — did you hear about it?  Over 1 million new jobs have been created across this country by businesses large and small since President Donald Trump took office.  More Americans working than ever before, and unemployment hasn’t been this low in 16 years.  And as the President tweeted this morning, we “have only just begun”!  (Applause.), But as important as our prosperity is, this President knows that security is the foundation of our prosperity.  And serving with him every day, I can assure you, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people., Our President has travelled across the wider world, reaffirming our historic alliances, challenging all who cherish freedom to step up and confront the forces that threaten our way of life.  President Trump I’m pleased to report — once again, we have a President who stands without apology on the world stage as leader of the free world.  (Applause.), And I have to tell you more personal to me, as the proud father of a United States Marine, I couldn’t be more grateful to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, their families, and our veterans.  (Applause.), The United States of America simply has the finest armed forces in the history of the world.  The men and women who wear the uniform of this country are the best of your generation, and I’m inspired whenever I’m among them.  Today, at Dover Air Force Base two heroes of this generation came home.  Sergeant Jonathon Hunter and Specialist Christopher Harris of the 82nd Airborne.  These two heroes fell defending our freedom in Afghanistan this week.  We honor their service and their sacrifice.  Their names will be enshrined in the hearts of a grateful nation, and their families and their loved ones will remain our prayers.  For no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.  These two men were heroes.  We honor them tonight by standing with all those who at this very hour stand a far distant post on the ramparts of freedom.  God bless them all.  (Applause.), And we honor them through our tributes, but we also honor them through our actions.  And I’ll make you a promise:  President Donald Trump is going to be the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States will have ever had in the White House.  (Applause.), You think about it, our President has already signed the largest increase in military spending in nearly 10 years.  And he’s called on the Congress to pass one of the biggest investments in our defense spending since the days of the Cold War., And under President Donald Trump, I’ll make you a promise:  We’re going to rebuild our military, we’re going to restore the arsenal of democracy, and we are once again going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe.  (Applause.), With the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief, I’m proud to report our armed forces are taking the fight to our enemy on our terms, on their soil.  And with President Donald Trump and our brave warriors in the field in Iraq and in Syrian, we will not rest, we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source, so it can no longer threaten our homeland or threaten our allies around the world.  (Applause.), And when it comes to security at home, our President has been busy as well — securing our borders, enforcing our laws, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our streets, gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminal gangs like MS-13.  And I’m pleased to report under President Donald Trump’s leadership and the efforts of our Homeland Security, illegal immigrant crossings on our southern border are down more than 60 percent since the first day of 2017.  (Applause.), So President Trump is keeping his promise to make America safe again, and I couldn’t be more grateful to serve with him., But frankly, let me say from my heart how meaningful it is to me to serve with a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of life.  (Applause.), In one of his very first acts in office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy to keep taxpayer funding out of organizations that perform and promote abortions abroad, and our President has expanded that policy to cover nearly $9 billion in foreign aid.  (Applause.), And President Trump has empowered states to withhold federal funding from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, and I’m humbled to say that at the President’s direction, I was able to cast the tie-breaking vote in Senate to allow states to defund Planned Parenthood.  (Applause.), So this President has been standing for the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.  And he’s been making sure that his appointments to courts of this land will adhere to the Constitution as it’s written, to strictly construe the Constitution.  The men and women that we’re putting forward to fill our federal benches are going to be people that uphold our highest traditions, like the newest member of Supreme Court of the United States — Justice Neil Gorsuch.   (Applause.), So it’s about jobs and prosperity.  It’s about security at home and abroad.  It’s our fundamental liberties, and it’s strengthening America each and every day.  President Trump has done all that and more, and it’s been only a little more than six months., But as the President likes to say, at this White House, that’s just what we call a good start.  (Applause.), The truth is we got a lot more work to do.  My fellow conservatives, let me assure you:  Job one for this administration going forward is we’re going to fight every day to keep the promise we made, and we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  (Applause.), Last week, it was clear that the Senate wasn’t quite ready to keep that promise to the American people, when they fell one vote short of moving forward on a bill to repeal and replace this disastrous policy., The truth is every day Obamacare survives is another day the American people struggle.  When Obamacare passed, we heard a lot of promises.  You remember?  We heard if you like your doctor, you can keep it — not true.  We heard if you like your health insurance, can you keep it — not true.  We heard that the cost of health insurance was going to go down.  That one sure wasn’t true.  In fact, we were promised that families would save up to $2,500 in health insurance premiums if this thing became law about seven years ago.  And the truth is the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than a plan did in 2013., And while premiums are soaring, choices are plummeting.  Next year, at least 40 percent of American counties, including nine whole states, will have only one choice of a health insurance provider, meaning they’ll essentially have no choice at all., Even worse, many counties will have no health insurance providers whatsoever in 2018 all across this country.  And it’s not just about the statistics.  It’s about real people.  It’s about small business owners, family farmers all across this country that are struggling to make ends meet., Behind every number is a name, behind every name is a story.  And I’ve heard these stories as I’ve traveled across America, and so has the President.  Small businesses that talk about the heartache of struggling to keep their whole workforce in place, people that have worked for them for years and years.  But with skyrocketing costs of health insurance, they got to choose between keeping the business going and keeping people on the payroll that they’ve known for years and years., I’ve talked to working families — literally a woman in Wisconsin told me that she had to take a pass on paying her health insurance premium for three months just so she’d have enough money to buy Christmas presents for her grandkids., We all know the truth, America knows the truth:  Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go.  (Applause.), Now, the President and I were disappointed when the Senate came up short in finishing what the House of Representatives had started.  In fact, the President said, every single one of those Democrats in the Senate and just a couple — handful of Republicans in his words “let the American people down”.  And that’s the truth of it., But my fellow conservatives, let me be clear:  This ain’t over, this ain’t by a long shot.  (Applause.), And President Trump — are absolutely committed to keep our promise to the American people.  We were not elected to save Obamacare; we were elected to repeal and replace it.  And you can know with confidence that President Donald Trump and I are going to fight every day until we end the Obamacare nightmare once and for all.  (Applause.), And when that day comes — and rest assured, it will come — we will begin to restore a healthcare system based on those timeless American principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform.  That’s the conservative way to meet the needs of this country in the 21st century when it comes to healthcare, and that is the American way to improve 21st century healthcare for this generation and the next.  (Applause.), And while we’re working with this Congress to act on healthcare, I’ll make you another promise:  President Donald Trump and I are going to roll our sleeves up, sit down with lawmakers, and we’re going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.)  We’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms., And President Trump is going cut business taxes in America so American companies can compete with companies around the world to create good-paying jobs right here in gold old USA.  (Applause.), So it’s about healthcare.  It’s about tax cuts.  And under this President’s leadership, and with the support of this Congress, we’re going to keep rolling forward.  We’ll make those historic investments in national defense to make America stronger and safer than ever before., We’ll keep reining in those unelected bureaucrats so they can’t cripple our economy from the comfort of those taxpayer-funded metal desks., We’ll enact real education reform to give families more choices and make it possible for every child to be able to go to the school of their choice and have access to the world-class education every child deserves.  It’s a lot of work to do., But I know I’m looking at a lot of young people that are anxious to get to it.  So to this rising generation of conservative leaders, I’ll tell you — you picked a great time to show up.  (Applause.) Because this the moment, now is the time., To finish what we’ve started, though, the President and I are counting on all of you.  We’re counting on this rising generation.  We need your voices.  We need your values.  We need your energy and your vision as never before., As this rising generation of American leaders, you know that your future, the future of this country depends on what we do in the days ahead.  No one has more stake in it than you., It was President Reagan who memorably said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,” and this rings just as true today as it did a half century ago when he said it., So I came here to night really to encourage you to keep standing up.  Keep speaking out. Let your voices heard.  With your peers and your colleagues, go out there and keep advocating without apology and with cheerfulness the common-sense conservative message that this country longs to hear., And from this day forward, the President and I are going to have to count on every ounce of your energy.  Your enthusiasm, your courage, your conviction, and your passion.  And I know we’ll have it., But there’s one more thing I might ask of you if you’re so inclined.  This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation — widening and unknowable threats around the world, too much division here at home, an economy that’s now beginning to get on its feet after years of struggling under the weight of big government.  And I would just say as you leave here from this great conference energized, hearing all these speakers that you heard this week, you go back to your homes and go back to your schools renewed in your determination to make a difference for conservative values, I’d encourage you if you’re inclined to bow the head and bend the knee, it would be a good time to do that, too., The truth is it’s a good time to pray for America because America matters far beyond our shores., And when I tell you to pray for America, I’m not so much talking about an agenda or a party, but really just pray for this country.  Abraham Lincoln I thought had it pretty right.  He was asked in his time if he thought God was on his side, and he said, I’d rather concern myself more with whether we’re on God’s side than whether God is our side., So just pray for this country.  Pray for all who serve her in every capacity because I truly do believe those ancient words of millennia ago are as true today as they’ve ever been, words that Americans have clung to in much more challenging times than these, that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, he’ll hear from Heaven, and he’ll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  (Applause.), AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So in a word, men and women of the Young America’s Foundation, have faith.  Have faith in the principles that you hold in your hearts that brought you to this place today.  Have faith in each other, and in your fellow conservatives, the ability to make a difference as conservatives have ever since this movement was born.  Have faith in this President, who I promise you and the whole team is fighting for you every.  And above all else, have a boundless faith in the American people, and in Him who placed this miracle of democracy on this wilderness shores, that He will still do as He’s always done, He will bless America., And so I say to this rising generation, with your support, with the leadership that we have in President Donald Trump and in our majorities in the House and Senate and all across this land, and with all of your shining faces, I’m confident, together, we will make America safe again.  Together, we will make America prosperous again.  And together, to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again., Thank you very much.  God bless the Young America’s Foundation and God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.), END, \\n7:28 P.M.

       "301  [Rose Garden, 3:32 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.  We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.  But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected., \\nBefore we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.  The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.  We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs., I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.  It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you., In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.  We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.  Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution., One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.  And believe me, we’ve just begun.  The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so., On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments.  And I don’t want anything to get in our way.  I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.  Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — (applause) — thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.  So we’re getting out.  But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.  And if we can, that’s great.  And if we can’t, that’s fine.  (Applause.), As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.  The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production., Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.  This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune., Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.  This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.  They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little., According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.  The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that., Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.  As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters., For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.  They can do whatever they want for 13 years.  Not us.  India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.  There are many other examples.  But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States., Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.  We’re having a big opening in two weeks.  Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.  A big opening of a brand-new mine.  It’s unheard of.  For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.  They asked me if I’d go.  I’m going to try., China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.  So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.  India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  Think of it:  India can double their coal production.  We’re supposed to get rid of ours.  Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants., In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries., \\nThis agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.  The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.  A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.  We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world., We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.  Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness., The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.  At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country — (applause) — will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life., Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.  Tiny, tiny amount.  In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes., As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  “The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate.”  The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.  We’ll be the cleanest.  We’re going to have the cleanest air.  We’re going to have the cleanest water.  We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.  We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.  (Applause.), And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.  One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years., I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.  (Applause.), So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.  We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.  And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.  And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.  And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.  But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement., I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world., No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.  The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.  That’s not going to happen while I’m President.  I’m sorry.  (Applause.), My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection., \\nOur tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well.  I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.  The Republicans are working very, very hard.  We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.  But it’s going very well., The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.  They don’t put America first.  I do, and I always will.  (Applause.), The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.  You see what’s happening.  It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind., At what point does America get demeaned?  At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?   We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.  We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.  And they won’t be.  They won’t be., I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.  (Applause.)  I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.  Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.  Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.  The process has begun from day one.  But now we’re down to business., Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.  So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.  Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime., The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.  That’s where they came.  Believe me, they didn’t come from me.  They came just before I came into office.  Not good.  And not good the way they took the money., In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as “peanuts,” and stated that “the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.”  In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.  And nobody even knows where the money is going to.  Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?, Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.  America is $20 trillion in debt.  Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.  Millions of our citizens are out of work.  And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.  So think of that., There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.  Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.  Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.  (Applause.)  Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.  And I will., Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.  It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal., The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.  In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point.  And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.  Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in., As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.  The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.  It is time to exit the Paris Accord — (applause) — and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country., It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France.  It is time to make America great again.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much., Thank you very much.  Very important.  I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words., Scott, please.  (Applause.), ADMINISTRATOR PRUITT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Your decision today to exit the Paris Accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first., And by exiting, you’re fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people.  Please know that I am thankful for your fortitude, your courage, and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country., America finally has a leader who answers only to the people — not to the special interests who have had their way for way too long.  In everything you do, Mr. President, you’re fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country.  You’re a champion for the hardworking citizens all across this land who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interest., You have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you’ve done that in any number of ways — from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, D.C.  And today you’ve put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment., This is an historic restoration of American economic independence — one that will benefit the working class, the working poor, and working people of all stripes.  With this action, you have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again.  And it should be noted that we as a nation do it better than anyone in the world in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment., We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.  After all, before the Paris Accord was ever signed, America had reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s.  In fact, between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18-plus percent.  And this was accomplished not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of the American private sector., For that reason, Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of world does little.  Other nations talk a good game; we lead with action — not words.  (Applause.), Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint to learn from us.  That should be our focus versus agreeing to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people., Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what’s right by the American people.  You have that courage, and the American people can take comfort because you have their backs., Thank you, Mr. President., END, \\n4:03 P.M.

       "302  [Mac Papers, \\nJacksonville, Florida, 2:38 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Florida! I want to thank your governor for that kind introduction. He’s been a friend for many years. And, ladies and gentleman, how about that governor, Rick Scott? (Applause.), Florida is incredibly fortunate to have a leader like Rick Scott. Since he took office, he’s signed over 50 tax cuts, he balanced the budget year after year, and he helped create more than 1.3 million jobs — one of the fastest-growing state economies in America. (Applause.) The sun is definitely shining on Florida State with Governor Rick Scott. Give him another round of applause, would you please? (Applause.), Governor, I have to tell you, President Trump and I are proud — proud to partner with you to make America great again. (Applause.) The same goes with all the other dedicated public servants who are here with us today. And I’m honored to be in their presence. Congressman John Rutherford, Mayor Lenny Curry — thank you for joining us., And, Seema Verma, it is such a privilege to have you here. Folks, I had the honor of swearing her in this past Tuesday as the 15th Administrator of America’s Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. She happens to be a Hoosier, and she’s one of the leading healthcare experts in the country, and she’s going to do an incredible job for people all across this country. (Applause.) Thank all these public servants. (Applause.) I can say with confidence Seema Verma is going to help us make American healthcare great again. And I want to thank you so much for your service, Seema. More than I can tell you, I’m incredibly proud., Now, it is a great privilege to be with all of you today, back in this great Sunshine State. Last fall, thanks to all of you — thanks to your hard work, your support, and your prayers — the people of Florida voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America. (Applause.) Florida made a difference. And the President asked me to stop by just to give his personal thanks to each and every one of you. Hardworking Americans like all of you were our biggest supporters., And on behalf of the President and his family, and on behalf of my little family: Thank you, Florida. Your votes have set us on a path to make America great again. And we’re here to say thanks. (Applause.), It was quite a campaign, wasn’t it? And it’s already been quite an administration. (Laughter.) It’s the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. He’s my friend. He’s a man who loves his family, he loves this country — boundless energy and optimism, broad shoulders and a big heart. And thanks I want to express on his behalf, as well., To all the great business owners who are with us today, we enjoyed a great conversation today about the issue that I’ll talk more about in just a moment. And join me in thanking these great job-creators in Jacksonville. Thank you for sharing your candid feedback about what we can do to help you grow jobs right here in Jacksonville. Give them all a word of thanks. (Applause.), Last but not least, I want to thank Mac McGehee and the whole Mac Paper team for hosting us here today. Mac, your family now for three generations have been a pillar in the Jacksonville community for over 50 years, and today you have over 600 employees spread across nine states. You only get that way when you’re doing something right and you’re doing it for a long time. The President and I thank you for all that you do. And let’s give the whole Mac Paper team a big round of applause for their great, great success and the jobs they’ve created here. (Applause.) Thank you., And let me assure you, let me assure all the job-creators, all the people that work for businesses large and small: President Trump, I can assure you — President Trump is going to be the best friend American small business will ever have. (Applause.), You know, I grew up in a small business — a small business family — actually in a small town in southern Indiana. It was a gas station business. I was a — I started working as a gas station attendant in one of my father’s gas stations when I was only 14 years of age. And for you young people in the room, we’ll explain later what a gas station attendant actually used to do. (Laughter.) As the whole world knows, the President also grew up in a family business, too., We actually both know, because of our life experiences in our families, we know the sacrifices that are required to make a business work. And more importantly, we know that when small business is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And President Trump is going to fight for small business America, just as he’s done from day one., We want to create jobs and prosperity and growth in America like never before. And small business is going to be the lion’s share of that. Just look at what the President has already done., On day one, President Trump went straight to work rolling back reams of red tape. He’s instructed literally every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new federal red tape on job-creators in America. (Applause.), He’s taken decisive action already to protect American jobs and American workers by ending illegal immigration once and for all. (Applause.), He also took action recently when he authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines that will create thousands of jobs and protect America’s energy future. (Applause.), And businesses are already responding to President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” vision with optimism and investment. From coast to coast — Governor Scott will back me up on this — companies are announcing that they’re keeping jobs here, they’re creating new jobs — tens of thousands of them. Just last month, the American economy added 235,000 new jobs, and we are just getting started. (Applause.), Under President Trump’s leadership and working with great congressmen like your congressman, John Rutherford, we’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We’re going to keep slashing through red tape, we’re going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can’t cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C. (Applause.), And because you hired a builder to be President of the United States, we’re going to rebuild this country so that Florida and every other state has the resources to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, the best airports, and the best future we could ever imagine, with the infrastructure that we need. (Applause.), But making America great again doesn’t just mean our economy. President Trump has no higher priority, I can assure you, than the safety and security of the American people. Over the past year, the American people watched in horror as terror struck Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale. Our support and our prayers have been with you ever since. And so, for that matter, I can assure you, is our resolve., Rest assured, President Trump will continue to take steps every single day to protect our nation, protect our way of life, and protect and prevent attacks by radical Islamic terrorism in this country again. (Applause.), Your former sheriff knows in his heart what people also know: President Donald Trump is standing with the men and women who serve in law enforcement in this country as never before. (Applause.), Some of you are sitting, a lot of you are standing, but would you all mind getting on your feet and thanking all the men and women in law enforcement who are here with us today? (Applause.) I promise you, under President Trump’s leadership, we’re going to make sure that the men and women who serve in law enforcement have the resources and the training and the tools that they need to protect our families and go home safe to theirs., The President has also taken steps to secure our nation, to secure our borders — which means building a wall, enforcing our laws, beginning with ensuring, as the President said before Congress, that gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities are off the streets of Florida and out of this country. (Applause.), And while we talk about security, this last Thursday President Trump unveiled his budget. It’s a budget that, at its very heart, will end the era of budget cuts for our armed forces. We will rebuild our military. We will restore the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) We will give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. That I promise you. (Applause.), And, lastly, by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch, who will go before the Congress this coming week, President Trump has kept his word to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court of the United States who will keep faith with the Constitution and uphold the God-given liberties that have been enshrined there for now more than two centuries. (Applause.), So we’ve been busy. We’ve been busy. My friends, President Trump is a man of his word, and he’s a man of action. And I believe he will make America great again. And make no mistake, about it: The Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.), It’s amazing — really amazing to think about it. Virtually every promise they made about Obamacare, when it was passed into law, has been broken. We all remember what they were. Remember? They told us the cost of health insurance would go down. Not true. They told us if you liked your doctors, you could keep them. Not true. They told us if you liked your health plan, you could keep it. Not true., Just the other day, I joined President Trump to listen to hardworking Americans who have suffered from these broken promises. They told us in visceral and in emotional terms the stories that I heard from business leaders today: skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer choices, higher taxes. They told us, just like these employers did today, about the hard choices that they’ve had to make, about how Obamacare is standing in the way of not only their companies’ aspirations, but the hopes and dreams of the people that work there and desire to work there. It was a heartbreaking conversation, then and now. And they’re not alone., Think about it: Just last year, premiums, following Obamacare, spiked by 25 percent on average across America. Millions have lost their plans. In one-third of the nation’s counties, Americans only have one insurance company to choose from — which essentially means they have no choice at all. Given all the failings, it’s no wonder that 400,000 fewer people enrolled in Obamacare this year., Now, your governor, I can tell you, has been remarkable on this. He mentioned just a few moments ago — we actually met when, as a private citizen, Rick Scott was fighting against Obamacare before it ever became law. (Applause.) And, Rick, let me thank you for that, and thank you for your ongoing leadership., As Governor Rick Scott said recently — and he knew this from the fight we fought then and the fight you fought every day since — that Obamacare was, in his words, “sold on a lie.” And then, in his typical plain-spoken way, Governor Scott said, it just plain “doesn’t work.” And he was right., Florida is actually a textbook example of everything that’s wrong with Obamacare. Here in the Sunshine State, Obamacare premiums rose by 19 percent last year — with some increasing by nearly 40 percent. Over 400,000 Floridians were scheduled to lose their plans at the start of this year. And nearly three-quarters — 75 percent — of the state has no choice at all when it comes to health insurance., The truth is, Florida can’t afford Obamacare anymore. And job-creators in Florida can’t afford it either. (Applause.) I heard it. I heard it earlier today. The small businesses represented here, they told me that Obamacare hits them with mandates, with regulations, with higher taxes and higher costs., Mac Paper is actually a great case in point. Since Obamacare went into effect, Mac was telling me that they’ve been forced to spend more than $300,000 not on jobs, not on investments that will create more jobs, but on just trying to comply with this failed law., That’s just not right. That money would have been better invested in your workers, Mac. And I know that’s where you would have liked to invest it — in payroll and in benefits, in your future, instead of being wasted on the failed policies of Obamacare., Men and women, this can’t continue. Every day that Obamacare survives is another day the American people and American businesses are struggling. Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.), Since the day Florida helped send President Trump to the White House, I can promise you he has been focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare with something that actually works., We know that the core flaw of Obamacare was this notion that you could order every American to buy health insurance whether they wanted it or needed it or not. That was never the answer., Just a few days ago in Nashville, President Trump actually called that Obamacare’s “fatal flaw.” The President couldn’t be more right. That’s why we’re going to end this flaw. We’re going to replace it with real solutions built on freedom, personal responsibility, and state flexibility and reform. That’s what works, and that’s what President Trump’s plan for healthcare reform will do for the American people. (Applause.), We’re going to begin, though, by repealing Obamacare’s taxes. We’re going to end its mandates by eliminating the penalties. We’re going to give Americans more choices. We’re going to expand health savings accounts for every American. We’re going to give Americans a tax credit that’ll help them buy the coverage they need at a price they can afford. And we’re also going to do it with what the President likes to call “big heart.” We’re going to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions still have access to the coverage that they need. And to you fellow parents out there with kids under the age of 26 — I have three — (laughter) — we’ll make sure you can keep your kids on your insurance until they’re 26 years of age. (Applause.), Now, folks, what I just laid out is only a small glimpse of everything our plan will do. The bill moving through the Congress, the American Health Care Act, is an important step in the right direction. We’re working around the clock with Congressman Rutherford and other members of the Republican majority in the House and the Senate; and with leaders here in Florida to make this bill even better., President Trump laid out a few key elements just yesterday with members of Congress in the Oval Office, and we’re going to continue to work with members of Congress to improve this bill. It’s what the legislative process is all about., And we’re not going to — we’re going to do a couple of different things with a few recent amendments that are worth mentioning and are owing in part to the engagement that we had with Congress., First off, we’re going to stop any more states from expanding Medicaid and adding a burden to future generations. We’re going to give states the option of block grants of Medicaid to the states so states like Florida can innovate and design Medicaid around the unique needs of the people in this community., And we’re going to allow states like Florida to include a work requirement for able-bodied adults ensuring that Medicaid’s benefits are available for those who need it the most. (Applause.), These are all common-sense solutions added to this legislation in a vigorous debate on Capitol Hill, and under the President’s leadership, we’ll continue to listen intently for ways to make this even better., Just yesterday, President Trump made it clear he supports the bill 100 percent, and we all do. Every day, more and more members of Congress are getting on board. And as we work to pass this first bill, rest assured our administration is also working with Dr. Tom Price over at Health and Human Services and with Seema Verma at the Center for Medicaid Services to give states like Florida the freedom and flexibility to help your most vulnerable in the ways that are going to be best for you., Just this past week, they sent a letter to Governor Scott and other state leaders around the country saying that “a new era for the federal and state Medicaid partnership” has begun — and so it is. (Applause.), The fact is, and I say this as a governor of the state of Indiana, that the fact is Florida is a unique state with unique needs — and this administration knows that state-based solutions, designed by your governor, your state legislature are the best way to give better coverage, and get better healthcare outcomes, particularly for the most vulnerable citizens across the state of Florida., And under President Trump’s leadership lastly just know this, we’re going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines — the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. (Applause.), That’s the combination. President Trump and I know that the way to lower costs is to increase choices to create a dynamic national marketplace, and that’s what our plan will do. Probably won’t be too long before you see Flo and some little lizard on television — (laughter) — selling health insurance. And that’s the American way., And let me say a couple of things to you before I slip off and get on that plane and head back south with your governor. I want to assure the people of Florida: We’re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America that makes affordable, high-quality health insurance accessible for every American. (Applause.), But be assured about this, be clear on this, though, folks, this is going to be a battle in Washington, D.C. All right? Obamacare’s defenders are working hard, so we have to work harder. And we’re counting on Florida. We need every Republican in Florida to support this bill and support the President’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare., AUDIENCE MEMBER: That’s why we voted., THE VICE PRESIDENT: And President Trump and I — President Trump and I are confident — we’re confident that with your support, Florida will be there, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all. (Applause.), It really is remarkable this time we find ourselves in, a time of renewed hope and boundless opportunity for the American people. I think we’re at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history that started last November the 8th., In this moment, though, I want to leave you with a challenge, we need every freedom-loving American who knew we could be stronger, who knew we could be better, who knew we could stand tall again to yourselves stand up and speak out. It’s time that we demanded government as good as our people. We need you to tell the world that we can do better, that we’re renewing and restoring this country, that we’re putting it back on a path to a brighter future. Tell your neighbors and your friends. Stop people outside the drug store. Just let them know how strongly you support the President’s vision for this country, particularly when it comes to healthcare., One of my favorite verses in the Old Book is from the Book of Jeremiah. It’s hung over the mantle of our home since I first ran for Congress successfully in the year 2000, and now it hangs over the mantle in the Vice President’s Residence in Washington, D.C., It simply reads: “For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.”, In November, I believe with all of my heart that the people of Florida and the people of this country voted to give America a President with the strength, the courage, and the vision, to make America safe again. You voted to give us a new leader who will make America prosperous again. And I know in my heart with your continued faith and support, together we will make America great again., Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. God bless you and God bless America.

       "303  [ , East Room, 2:26 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Melania, for your moving words and for your devotion — it’s a very deep devotion, I can tell you that — to our nation and its children., Thank you also to members of Congress, my Cabinet, governors, members of Congress, state, local leaders, first responders, and healthcare professionals gathered here today.  We have some truly incredible people in this room — that I can tell you., Most importantly, we acknowledge the families present who have lost a cherished loved one.  As you all know from personal experience, families, communities, and citizens across our country are currently dealing with the worst drug crisis in American history and even, if you really think about it, world history.  This is all throughout the world.  The fact is this is a worldwide problem., This crisis of drug use, addiction, and overdose deaths in many years, it’s just been so long in the making.  Addressing it will require all of our effort and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its very real complexity., Last year, we lost at least 64,000 Americans to overdoses.  That’s 175 lost American lives per day.  That’s seven lost lives per hour in our country.  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States by far., More people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined.  Think of it — motor vehicle crashes, gun homicides, more people by far from drug overdoses., These overdoses are driven by a massive increase in addiction to prescription painkillers, heroin, and other opioids.  Last year, almost 1 million Americans used heroin, and more than 11 million abused prescription opioids.  The United States is by far the largest consumer of these drugs, using more opioid pills per person than any other country by far in the world.  Opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999 and now account for the majority of fatal drug overdoses.  Who would have thought?, No part of our society — not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural — has been spared this plague of drug addiction and this horrible, horrible situation that’s taken place with opioids., In West Virginia — a truly great state, great people — there is a hospital nursery where one in every five babies spends its first days in agony.  Because these precious babies were exposed to opioids or other drugs in the womb, they endure nausea, pain, anxiety, sleeplessness, and trouble eating, just the same as adults undergoing detox., Some of these children will likely lose one or both of their parents to drug addiction and overdose.  They will join the growing ranks of America’s opioid orphans.  Such beautiful, beautiful babies., Beyond the shocking death toll, the terrible measure of the opioid crisis includes the families ripped apart and, for many communities, a generation of lost potential and opportunity., This epidemic is a national health emergency, unlike many of us we’ve seen and what we’ve seen in our lifetimes.  Nobody has seen anything like what’s going on now., As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.  Never been this way.  We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.  We can do it.  (Applause.)  We can do it., That is why, effective today, my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law, and why I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis.  This marks a critical step in confronting the extraordinary challenge that we face., As part of this emergency response, we will announce a new policy to overcome a restrictive 1970s-era rule that prevents states from providing care at certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds for those suffering from drug addiction.  (Applause.), A number of states have reached out to us asking for relief, and you should expect to see approvals that will unlock treatment for people in need.  And those approvals will come very, very fast.  Not like in the past — very, very quickly., Ending the epidemic will require mobilization of government, local communities, and private organizations.  It will require the resolve of our entire country., The scale of this crisis of addiction is why, soon after coming into office, I convened a presidential commission, headed by Governor Chris Christie, that has consulted with experts across America to listen, to learn, and report back on potential solutions., We await the final report, which will come in next week.  And I know some of the report has already been seen, because I want to see it as quickly as possible.  And some of the things that they are recommending are common sense, but very, very important.  And they’re going to have a tremendous impact, believe me — tremendous impact., Today, I will detail many of these aggressive steps with my administration, which we’ve already taken.  After we review and evaluate the commission’s findings, I will quickly move to implement approximate and appropriate recommendations., But I want the American people to know:  The federal government is aggressively fighting the opioid epidemic on all fronts.  We’re working with doctors and medical professionals to implement best practices for safe opioid prescribing, and we will do something very, very special.  We are requiring federally employed prescribers to receive, finally, special training., The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a prescription awareness campaign to put faces on the danger of opioid abuse., I want to acknowledge CVS Caremark for announcing last month that it will limit certain first-time opioid prescriptions to seven-day supplies, among other important reforms.  And I encourage other companies to do their part to help to stop this epidemic.  (Applause.), The FDA is now requiring drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids to provide more training to prescribers and to help prevent abuse and addiction, and has requested that one especially high-risk opioid be withdrawn from the market immediately.  We are requiring that a specific opioid, which is truly evil, be taken off the market immediately.  (Applause.), The U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Homeland Security are strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China and 50 times stronger than heroin., And in two weeks, I will be in China with President Xi, and I will mention this as a top priority.  (Applause.)  And he will do something about it., I am also pleased to report that for the first time, the Department of Justice has indicated [indicted] major Chinese drug traffickers for distributing — and they have really put very, very strong clamps on them.  They’ve indicted them, the drug traffickers, for distributing fentanyl in the United States.  So, Jeff, thank you very much.  Good job.  (Applause.), And they’ve been indicted and we’re not going to forget about them, believe me.  They are doing tremendous harm to our country.  The Justice Department is aggressively and, really, valiantly pursuing those who illegally prescribe and traffic in opioids, both in our communities and on the Internet., And I will be looking at the potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad actors.  What they have and what they’re doing to our people is unheard of.  We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that are hurting our people.  And that will start taking place pretty soon.  (Applause.), We’re also supporting first responders’ and medical professionals’ access to the tools they need to prevent deaths through life-saving overdose medications., At my direction, the National Institute of Health, headed up by Francis Collins, has taken the first steps of an ambitious public-private partnership with pharmaceutical companies to develop non-addictive painkillers and new treatments for addiction and overdose.  So important.  (Applause.), I will be pushing the concept of non-addictive painkillers very, very hard.  We have to come up with that solution.  We give away billions and billions of dollars a year, and we’re going to be spending lots of money on coming up with a non-addictive solution., We will be asking Dr. Collins and the NIH for substantial resources in the fight against drug addiction.  One of the things our administration will be doing is a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place because they will see the devastation and the ruination it causes to people and people’s lives., Watch what happens, if we do our jobs, how the number of drug users and the addicted will start to tumble downward over a period of years.  It will be a beautiful thing to see., I learned, myself — I had a brother, Fred — great guy, best-looking guy, best personality — much better than mine.  (Laughter.)  But he had a problem.  He had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, “Don’t drink.  Don’t drink.”  He was substantially older, and I listened to him and I respected, but he would constantly tell me, don’t drink.  He’d also add, don’t smoke.  But he would say it over and over and over again., And to this day, I’ve never had a drink.  And I have no longing for it.  I have no interest in it.  To this day, I’ve never had a cigarette.  Don’t worry, those are only two of my good things.  I don’t want to tell you about the bad things.  (Laughter.)  There’s plenty of bad things too., But he really helped me.  I had somebody that guided me, and he had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol — believe me, very, very tough, tough life.  He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through.  But I learned because of Fred.  I learned., And that’s what I think is so important.  This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs — just not to take them.  When I see friends of mine that are having difficulty with not having that drink at dinner, where it’s literally almost impossible for them to stop, I say to myself, I can’t even understand it — why would that be difficult?  But we understand why it is difficult., The fact is, if we can teach young people — and people, generally — not to start, it’s really, really easy not to take them.  And I think that’s going to end up being our most important thing.  Really tough, really big, really great advertising, so we get to people before they start, so they don’t have to go through the problems of what people are going through.  (Applause.)  Thank you., We are already distributing nearly $1 billion in grants for addiction prevention and treatment, and over $50 million dollars to support law enforcement programs that assist those facing prison and facing addiction., We have also launched an $81 million partnership to research better pain management techniques for our incredible veterans.  And soon — (applause) — and, by the way, Secretary Shulkin is here.  You have done an incredible job for our veterans in a very short period of time.  (Applause.)  And soon, HHS will launch a taskforce to develop and update best practices for pain management across the federal government., I am urging all Americans to help fight this opioid epidemic and the broader issue of drug addiction by participating in the National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day this Saturday.  When you can safely turn in these dangerous and horrible drugs for disposal, that will be a wonderful, wonderful period of time for you., All of these actions are important parts of my administration’s larger effort to confront the drug addiction crisis in America and confront it head on, straight on — strong.  We’re going to do it.  We’re going to do it., For too long, we have allowed drugs to ravage American homes, cities, and towns.  We owe it to our children and our country to do everything in our power to address this national shame and this human tragedy., We must stop the flow of all types of illegal drugs into our communities.  (Applause.)  For too long, dangerous criminal cartels have been allowed to infiltrate and spread throughout our nation.  An astonishing 90 percent of the heroin in America comes from south of the border, where we will be building a wall which will greatly help in this problem.  (Applause.)  It will have a great impact.  My administration is dedicated to enforcing our immigration laws, defending our maritime security, and securing our borders., We also have to work with other countries to stop these drugs where they originate.  We have no choice.  We have to work with others, we have to get together, because they have similar problems to what we have.  Some countries have bigger problems than we have.  Whether that country is China, whether it’s a country in Latin America, it makes no difference.  We’re going to be working with all of them.  We’re taking the fight directly to the criminals in places that they’re producing this poison., Here in America, we are once again enforcing the law; breaking up gangs and distribution networks; and arresting criminals who peddle dangerous drugs to our youth., In addition, we understand the need to confront reality, right smack in the face, that millions of our fellow citizens are already addicted.  That’s the reality.  We want them to get the help they need.  We have no choice but to help these people that are hooked and are suffering so they can recover and rebuild their lives with their families., We’re committed to pursuing innovative approaches that have been proven to work, like drug courts.  Our efforts will be based on sound metrics, and guided by evidence and guided by results.  This includes making addiction treatment available to those in prison and to help them eventually reenter society as productive and law-abiding citizens., Finally, we must adopt the most common-sense solution of all: to prevent our citizens from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place.  (Applause.), We must and are focusing so much of our effort on drug demand reduction.  We must confront the culture of drug abuse head-on to reduce demand for dangerous narcotics.  Every person who buys illicit drugs here in America should know that they are risking their futures, their families, and even their lives.  And every American should know that if they purchase illegal drugs, they are helping to finance some of the most violent, cruel, and ruthless organizations anywhere in the world.  Illegal drug use is not a victimless crime.  There is nothing admirable, positive, or socially desirable about it.  There is nothing desirable about drugs.  They’re bad., We want the next generation of young Americans to know the blessings of a drug-free life.  In this enormous struggle against drug addiction, an opioid epidemic — it really is that; it is an epidemic — our greatest hope is the same as it has always been.  Through every trial America has encountered throughout our history, the spirit of our people and the strength of our character, we win.  Each of us has a responsibility to this effort.  We have a total responsibility to ourselves, to our family, to our country, including those who are struggling with this addiction., Each of us is responsible to look out for our loved ones, our communities, our children, our neighbors, and our own health.  Almost every American has witnessed the horrors of addiction.  Whether it’s through their own struggle or through the struggle of a friend, a coworker, a neighbor or, frankly, a family member, our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better.  But get better it will.  It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency., We are inspired by the stories of everyday heroes who pull their communities from the depths of despair through leadership and through love., Fire Chief Dan Goonan, of New Hampshire — great state — runs a program, Safe Station, which allows drug-dependent residents to seek help at fire stations at any time., Jesse and Cyndi Swafford of Dayton, Ohio have provided a loving, stable home to children affected by the opioid crisis., I am calling on every American to join the ranks of guardian angels like Chief Goonan and the Swaffords, who help lift up the people of our great nation., Together, we will care for our citizens, our children, and our orphans and our — and you know what I’m going to say — our foster youth.  So many.  So many.  But we’re going to lift them up, and we’re going to take care of them.  We will work to strengthen vulnerable families and communities, and we will help to build and grow a stronger, healthier, and drug-free society., Together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need., Working together, we will defeat this opioid epidemic.  It will be defeated.  We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse.  And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America.  We are going to overcome addiction in America., We have fought and won many battles and many wars before, and we will win again., Thank you.  God bless you.  And God Bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.), Thank you.  Here we go.  This is very important:  “Combatting the National Drug Demand and Opioid Crisis.”  Right?  So important.  We will win, right?, (The presidential memorandum is signed.)  (Applause.), END, 2:53 P.M.

       "304  [Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, \\nDallas, Texas, 12:55 P.M. CDT, Well, hello NRA!  (Applause.)  Thank you, Chris, for that kind introduction.  Chris knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter.  (Laughter.)  I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.  And I’m a card-carrying member of the NRA.  (Applause.), To Wayne LaPierre, to Governor Abbott, to the distinguished members of Congress, to all my fellow Americans who’ve come from near and far, it is great to be back at the 147th annual meeting of the National Rifle Association.  Thank you all.  (Applause.), And I’m especially proud to be here with a good friend of mine — (laughter) — a great champion of our most cherished liberties, and a man, I can tell you, who can’t wait to get out here: The 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), You know, last year, President Trump spoke to this very gathering; the first President to do so in 34 years.  (Applause.)  And he told you then, in his words, that, “You have a true friend in the White House.”  And I’m here today, as his Vice President, to tell you that you have two friends in the White House.  (Applause.), President Donald Trump and I both stand without apology for the Second Amendment.  And in this administration, the right of the people to keep and bear arms will not be infringed.  (Applause.), That right is truly one of our first and most important freedoms.  Our founders won our independence with the power of their ideas and their muskets.  Our pioneers won the west, and expanded the frontiers of freedom, with their daring, their courage, and their Springfields, Winchesters, and Colts.  (Applause.), From generation to generation, our forebears have fought our nation’s wars and defended our way of life with the skills they learned on the rifle range, or in a dove field, or in a deer stand, or at the knee of a father or grandfather back home., And in our own day, there is no greater champion of America’s tradition of responsible gun ownership than you, the men and women of the National Rifle Association.  (Applause.), The National Rifle Association is an organization forged in freedom.  For nearly 150 years, the NRA has valiantly defended the Constitution and all our God-given liberties., In its early years, the NRA helped train our fellow citizens in gun safety and marksmanship — a tradition that continues even as this organization has gone on to become one of the principal defenders of our Second Amendment rights., Today, more than 5 million Americans are proud members of the NRA.  And the work you do is essential to preserving our freedoms at every level of the American government.  So give yourselves a round of applause for all you do for the ideals we cherish.  (Applause.), And President Trump and I came here today, mostly, just to say, “thanks.”  Thank you for all you do to defend liberty.  And thank you for electing a President and a Congress that are making America great again.  (Applause.), Because of your support, on Election Day and every day since, you can only describe this administration one way: It’s been 15 months of promises made and promises kept.  And we’re just getting started.  (Applause.), I mean, think about it.  President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy.  And just over one month ago, President Trump signed into law the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.), Our President promised to enforce our laws and secure our borders.  We’ve taken on sanctuary cities.  We’re fighting to end catch-and-release and close all the dangerous immigration loopholes in our laws.  The President signed into law the biggest funding increase for border security in nearly a decade and even ordered the National Guard to the southern border.  Under this President’s leadership, we’ve nearly doubled the arrests of vicious gang members in MS-13.  (Applause.)  And thanks to the leadership of President Trump, Congress approved funding for the first 100 miles of a border wall.  (Applause.), And I’ll make you a promise.  When it comes to that big border wall, we’re going to build it all.  (Applause.), This President has also stood for all the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.  And I have tell you, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life.  (Applause.), To protect all our unalienable rights, President Trump promised to appoint strong conservatives to the federal courts at every level.  And we’ve been busy at it.  We actually, in the last year, set a record for most court of appeals judges confirmed in a single year in American history, and that doesn’t even count Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court of the United States.  (Applause.), And when it comes to security here at home, our President and I promised to stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line of law enforcement.  And so we have.  (Applause.), As we all know, the men and women of law enforcement risk their lives every day to serve and protect our families, our neighbors, and our communities.  And that’s why under President Donald Trump’s leadership, we’ve made new resources available to law enforcement at every level.  And we will continue to give all the heroes of law enforcement the training, tools, and the respect that they deserve as they protect our families in communities across this nation.  (Applause.), You know, the American people will always remember the heroes of the Dallas Police Department who fell in the line of duty nearly two years ago in that attack that claimed the lives of five officers and left nine others injured., Sadly, just last week, another brutal act of violence struck this city, leaving one Dallas Police officer dead and injuring another officer and a security guard.  I know I speak for everyone here when I say that we are praying for the family of Officer Rogelio Santander, and for the swift recovery of Scott Painter and Officer Crystal Almeida.  They are heroes, and they are on our hearts and in our prayers.  (Applause.), We live in challenging times, for as we all know, it hasn’t just been our law enforcement community that’s faced mindless violence of late.  We live in a time where mass shootings have claimed hundreds of lives in places of work, and worship, and public settings, shocking the conscience of the nation.  An ISIS-inspired attack on the Pulse Night Club, in Orlando.  An attack on a country music concert, last year, in Las Vegas — the worst mass shooting in modern history.  And the recent attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida., These, and too many other acts of violence, shattered families and left our nation searching for answers.  We mourn with those who mourn, and grieve with those who grieve.  But we also resolve to confront this menace with all our strength.  And we are doing just that under the leadership of this President.  (Applause.)  And I promise you, under President Trump’s leadership, we will not rest and we will not relent until we end this evil in our time., You know, in recent days, after these tragedies, America has seen President Trump’s leadership on full display.  He hosted a listening session at the White House with students, and teachers, and parents still grieving from the shooting in Parkland, Florida.  We listened to their stories.  We heard all sides of the debate.  I’ll never forget it., As the President has said, in his words, “It’s not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we’re making a difference.  We must actually make that difference.”  And so we have.  (Applause.), Just over one month ago, President Trump signed the STOP School Violence Act, with the strong support of the parents of Sandy Hook Promise and the NRA.  (Applause.), We’re now providing more than $2 billion to help local governments ensure the security of their schools and the safety of our students.  It represents the single largest investment in school safety in American history.  (Applause.), President Trump also signed critical legislation to fix the National Instant Background Check System to keep deadly weapons way from those who should never have them in the first place.  And we’re pursuing new resources to ensure that those struggling with serious mental illness have access to the treatment that they need.  (Applause.), With the President’s leadership, we’ve joined the NRA to call on states to give families and law enforcement the tools they need to stop mass shootings before they happen, because we know we can protect public safety and due process at the same time.  (Applause.), And President Trump has urged leaders all across America to follow the example of states like Indiana, and allow qualified school personnel on a voluntary basis to carry concealed weapons, because the quickest way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun!  (Applause.), This is real leadership, men and women.  And these are real results that will give law enforcement, families, and our schools new resources and tools to protect our students and ensure public safety., And I promise you we will continue to bring American solutions to bear on this crisis.  We will end this evil and protect our liberties at the same time.  That’s the American way.  (Applause.), The American people deserve to know about what we’ve done and what we’re doing, because quite frankly, most in the media won’t talk about it, and we all know why., AUDIENCE:  Booo —, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Most of the national media is working an agenda very different than most of us in this room.  I mean, not only does the media too often ignore what our President is accomplishing, but they also won’t tell the whole story about firearms in America., I mean, think about it: They focus on the tragedies and the heartbreak.  And well they should.  But too often, many in the national media all but ignore what happens when well-trained, law-abiding gun owners save lives.  It’s the truth.  (Applause.), And the reality is, throughout American history — it’s been proven time and time again — firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens makes our communities more safe, not less.  (Applause.), Let me tell you a few stories that you don’t hear much about in the national media, but they prove the point., Like the off-duty Marine in Atlanta, in 2009, who was attending a party that was overtaken by two would-be murderers.  After the attackers separated the men and women, Sean Barner was able to get to the concealed firearm in his backpack.  He killed one and ran off the other, preventing a terrible tragedy.  (Applause.), Or how about the passerby outside a Philadelphia barbershop in 2015.  He heard gunfire inside, he rushed in, he shot the attacker in the chest.  And the Philadelphia Police Captain said, “He saved a lot of people in there.”  And he did.  (Applause.), Or how about the Uber driver in Chicago, the same year, who saw a man open fire on a crowd of people on a Friday night.  He pulled out his concealed weapon, he engaged the shooter, he hit the attacker multiple times, and saved the lives of people on that street that he’s never even met.  (Applause.), Or the story from just down the road, in Arlington, Texas, where exactly one year ago yesterday, a crazed man entered a bar, killed the manager, was prepared to kill countless others, when he was stopped cold by another patron, a fella who took his wife to dinner that night and had a firearm at his side.  (Applause.), I mean, the truth is that these are the stories we don’t hear much about, yet they’re the stories that America most needs to hear., And so today, I want to call on the national media.  Start telling the whole story to the American people about firearms in this country.  (Applause.)  I mean, it’s time the national media gave our many heroes as much attention as they give to our few villains, because we should be a nation that recognizes the people who save lives much more than the people who take them.  (Applause.), It’s the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President.  (Applause.)  Truly is.  And I thank you all.  You know, the last two years have been filled with sights and sounds this small-town boy could’ve never imagined that I’d live to see., But for Karen and me, our most inspiring moment came in the wake of one of our nation’s darkest days, when we spent time with some extraordinary Americans not far from here, in a place called Sutherland Springs, Texas.  (Applause.), We all know the story — you just heard it again — of a Sunday morning in November when a deranged man entered the sanctuary of the First Baptist Church and murdered 26 believers, including 9 children, and injured 20 more., A few days after the attack, the President sent us to that small town to pray and to comfort and to stand with those families.  And it was our great honor.  (Applause.), We grieve with those who grieve, and we prayed.  But as the Good Book says, we did not grieve like those who have no hope –because the faith of those families, and the heroes minted that day, gave us hope.  (Applause.), Walking through the library at the nearby high school, we spent time with each of the grieving families just before a memorial service.  They were still shattered by the evil of that Sunday morning.  We saw the pain of unspeakable loss in their eyes.  But as I told Pastor Pomeroy, I just yesterday at the White House, Karen and I were so inspired by the faith in Christ that radiated out of every one of those families.  (Applause.), But it wasn’t just the faith of the families of the fallen.  That day, we also met, for the first time, the heroes of Sutherland Springs on a street corner just outside the church.  As America would learn on that fateful morning, when one man heard the gunshots, he ran toward the danger, his firearm in hand.  He shot the attacker twice.  And with another man’s help, they pursued that murderer in a high-speed chase., While the losses that day were indescribable, what was clear later is that it actually could have been worse.  The murderer had ammunition and arms that would have claimed even more lives, but for the courage of an NRA instructor and the newest recipient of the “Defender of Freedom” award, Stephen Willeford.  (Applause.)  Stephen, it is an honor to share this stage with you today., The Second Amendment is a shield for the rights of every American, and it’s a shield for the most vulnerable.  It’s the “great equalizer” that gives every American the power to defend themselves and their families against any evil in our midst., And for the sake of our freedom, for the safety of our people, and for the security of our nation, President Donald Trump and I will always stand for the right to keep and bear arms.  (Applause.), As I close, let me simply encourage you — encourage you to remember that our freedom always needs defending.  As my second favorite President, Ronald Reagan — (laughter and applause) — once said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”, And make no mistake about it, men and women: This is a pivotal year in the life of our nation.  And in this year, I want to challenge all of you — all the men and women of the National Rifle Association, here and across the country — stay in the fight; exercise all of your fundamental rights; live out the citizenship in a way that’s long made the NRA one of the most potent forces for good in the United States of America.  And do it this year.  (Applause.), Carry freedom forward.  Support men and women in public office who support our liberties.  And talk to your coworkers, and neighbors, and friends, and family at worship and at work.  Talk to them about the progress that we’ve made together, and all that we can do in the days ahead., Tell our story.  Tell what President Trump has meant to this nation in restoring our strength at home and abroad.  Remind them that we cut their taxes so they can keep more of what they earn.  (Applause.)  Remind them that we’re restoring American strength at home and abroad to protect their families and our freedom.  Remind them that we’re standing with law enforcement and all the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution.  Just go out there and tell them.  (Applause.)  Tell them we got the government working for them, not the other way around.  Go tell them that the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more!  You just go tell them, and tell them this year.  (Applause.), And if you’re of a mind, there’s one thing more I might urge you to do.  In this time of too much division in these United States, too much anger and even violence, I want to encourage you, if you’re so inclined, to bow the head and bend the knee in the days ahead, and pray for America.  (Applause.), And when you pray, pray with confidence, because I’ll always believe that those words recorded millennia ago that Americans have clung to throughout our history are every bit as true today as they’ve ever been in these divided times, that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll do like He’s always done through the long and storied history of this land: He’ll hear from heaven, and He’ll heal this land — (applause) — this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty, and justice for all.  (Applause.), Well, I need to get out of your way because your next speaker is about ready to come out.  (Applause.)  But I want to thank you for the honor of addressing you.  I leave here with renewed confidence, with the support of all the freedom-loving Americans gathered here and looking on across the country, with continued conservative leadership in the Congress of the United States, with President Donald Trump in the White House — (applause) — and with God’s help, we will make America prosperous again.  We will make America safe again.  And as he loves to say, we will make America great again., Thank you very much.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.), END, 1:23 P.M.

       "305  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, \\n2:45 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Let me start by saying what a meaningful experience it was to attend yesterday’s ceremony preceding the lying in honor of Reverend Billy Graham.  Reverend Graham left this Earth last week, but his legacy will live on for eternity., As the President said during his remarks, “Everywhere he went, Reverend Graham delivered the same beautiful message: God loves you.”  That’s a message that we should all stop and really consider a little more often.  The President and First Lady will also be attending Reverend Graham’s funeral in North Carolina tomorrow., I’d like to highlight some positive and important work the House did on Tuesday by passing H.R. 1865.  This bill empowers federal, state, and local prosecutors to hold websites accountable for supporting the sale of sex-trafficking victims., As you may recall, the President and Ivanka Trump met with survivors, law enforcement officials, and victims’ advocates here at the White House.  He made it clear that this administration will fight to hold sex traffickers accountable and to ensure survivors have the support they need., This bill is an important step forward.  And the White House appreciates the House taking action on a bipartisan basis., Earlier this week, I mentioned that we were going to begin regularly highlighting the historic obstruction of Senate Democrats, an issue that threatens the safety and security of the American people., As a reminder, compared to the four previous administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees.  Half of the President’s highly qualified nominees are still waiting on confirmation., Today, we have another example.  Two-hundred and seventy-six days ago, Kevin McAleenan was nominated to be Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  Kevin’s primary responsibility would be to help safeguard American borders, keeping both terrorists and their weapons out of our nation, all while facilitating lawful international trade.  Kevin should be preventing terrorists and contraband from entering the nation, yet he is still awaiting Senate confirmation., Senator Schumer should stop putting the safety and security of the American people at risk and immediately confirm him., And with that, I will take your questions.  John., Q    Sarah, the President announced, at the meeting a little while ago, punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that would take effect next week.  Ten percent for aluminum; twenty-five percent for steel.  He announced them even though the fine details have not been worked out yet about what countries will be involved, whether there are any exemptions.  The Dow is down about 500 points as a result of this.  Some of our allies, including Canada, are saying that these actions are unacceptable.  Why did the President announce them now, particularly before the details have even been worked out?, MS. SANDERS:  The President is announcing his intent to sign those actions next week.  We’re not going to get into any more details until those details are finalized, but that is what he intends to do next week, when he was making that announcement., Q    Is he concerned about the results or the effects that his announcement has had so far?, MS. SANDERS:  The President is concerned about the men and women of this country who have been forgotten about, the industries that our country was founded and built on.  And this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anybody.  This is something, frankly, the President has been talking about for decades; certainly something he talked about regularly on the campaign trail; and something that he’s delivering on, making that clear today.  And those details and that actual announcement and signing will take place sometime next week., Margaret., Q    Sarah, the President often talks about stock market reaction to his Presidency.  Is he surprised to see the market down after making this announcement without explanation on tariffs?  And do you have any detail on why he decided to announce it today?  As John was asking, you know, it seemed kind of sudden when we were called in for that event.  It wasn’t something on our, necessarily, public schedule., MS. SANDERS:  This is something, again, that the President has been talking about for a long time.  It’s not a surprise.   And we’re going to continue doing what we can to protect American workers.  That was something that the President committed to during the campaign.  This is something that he feels is vitally important., Q    But 25 and 10 percent is specific, and that was new., MS. SANDERS:  Yeah.  That part is new.  And he’s announcing his intent to make those things happen next week.  And we’ll have more details on that., Q    Did he make that decision today?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, this is something the President has wanted to do for quite some time., Q    But why was it a surprise to, you know, the press gathered there?  It wasn’t on the schedule when we were through —, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t think that the President always tells you guys everything first, but it’s certainly something he’s been talking about for a long time., Q    Well, it seemed like you haven’t told some at the White House, because there were these competing events., MS. SANDERS:  Look, these are conversations that the President has been having for a long time.  He’s made his intentions very clear to the team at the White House.  And I don’t think it came as a surprise to anybody here., Q    Can you say that 10 and 25 are set, or could that change between now and next week?, MS. SANDERS:  I think that’s the intent, but until those details are finalized, I’m not going to get into any more specifics right now., Zeke., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  A couple questions for you.  First, a number of the members of the President’s Cabinet have fallen under public scrutiny; in some cases, inspectors general, for spending, whether it be first-class travel.  In the case of Ben Carson, a $31,000 dining set.  The President talked about it on the campaign that he was going to drain the swamp.  So does he plan on draining some of his Cabinet?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t — in terms of if you’re asking if he’s getting rid of anyone on the Cabinet, I’m not aware that that’s taking place at any point right now.  To be clear, on Secretary Carson, the order that you referenced was cancelled and they’re looking for another option that’s much more responsible with taxpayer dollars., Q    Well, Sarah, you said a number of times that when the President loses confidence in a member of the Cabinet, he tells us.  So that means we haven’t heard that, so he has confidence in these people.  So can you explain why the President has confidence in some of these members of his Cabinet — in Carson, Shulkin, Pruitt, Zinke — there have been a number — there are numerous investigations into some of their conduct and spending?  So why do they have the President’s confidence?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, starting with the VA, with Secretary Shulkin, the President is glad for the job that he’s been doing in reforming the VA and modernizing the VA, a lot of the movements that they’ve had there.  And he supports him in those efforts., But they’re also — we have been reviewing these actions and making sure that we’re being very responsible with taxpayer dollars.  This is something that the President has asked all of his team to go back and look at., Q    Just one quick one on guns.  Senator McConnell, up on Capitol Hill, a few minutes ago, said that next week the Senate would not be moving forward with the Fix NICS legislation that Senator Cornyn has put forward, and Cornyn said that they’re going to be discussing (inaudible) regulation and potentially also human trafficking next week, and not gun legislation., After yesterday’s session, it seems that Republicans are running away from what the President wanted a, sort of, quick solution to this — a quick resolution on this front.  Why didn’t the President have the clout on Capitol Hill that a President — this is a Republican President, Republican Congress — why can’t he seem to get Congress to bend to his will?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t think it’s necessarily about bending to his will.  I think it’s about an ongoing discussion about the best pieces of legislation that they can put forward.  Yesterday was certainly an important part of that.  The President has met with a number of stakeholders.  Next week, he’ll also be meeting with members of the videogame industry to see what they can do on that front as well., This is going to be an ongoing process and something that we don’t expect to happen overnight, but something that we’re going to continue to be engaged in and continue to look for the best ways possible to make sure we’re doing everything we can to protect schools across the country., Cecilia., Q    Sarah, does the President want to get rid of his Attorney General?, MS. SANDERS:  Not that I know of., Q    And how about Jared Kushner?, MS. SANDERS:  No., Q    Is Jared Kushner becoming a distraction, given all the controversies that he’s been at the center of in recent days?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, Jared is still a valued member of the administration and he’s going to continue to focus on the work that he’s been doing, and we’re going to continue pushing forward on that front as well., Q    And are there any concerns about conflict of interest, given those meetings that he had with executives from companies that gave his family business millions of dollars in loans?, MS. SANDERS:  I would refer you to the statement that was put out by his attorney., Q    But conflict of interest appearance even?  Concerns about that here at this White House?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I would have to refer you to the statement put out by his attorney., Jon., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Back on the tariffs announcement.  Is the President concerned about the impact that this may have on America’s allies, like Canada, the UK, the EU?, MS. SANDERS:  The President’s biggest concern is making sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect American workers, and that was what his announcement on his intentions next week are specifically geared towards.  This isn’t something that he’s shied away from or something that he hasn’t spoken about regularly and often, or something that he’s going to stop talking about at any point soon., Q    Is the President concerned about any retaliation coming from any of the countries that may be impacted by this announcement?, MS. SANDERS:  Not that I’m aware of., Q    And one final thing.  Just wanted to ask you about a comment and get your reaction to — Republican Senator Ben Sasse put out a statement in regards to these new tariffs.  He said that, “The President is proposing a massive tax increase on American families.  Protectionism is weak, not strong.”  And he concluded by writing, “You’d expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.”  Do you have a comment on that?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t know that the President will, or should ever, apologize for protecting American workers.  And certainly not to Senator Sasse., Blake., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Let me try to drill down on this.  You say you won’t be getting into details at this point.  So if there are details to get into, should we read into it that there will be exemptions for certain countries?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of the final details that will be put out next week.  At this point, there’s no additional information to share as this is all being finalized., Q    Has the President made up, in his mind, which countries he might exempt or at least is considering?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get into any details on this front and I don’t have anything further to add on his intentions that will take place next week., We’re a little bit tight so I’m going to keep moving.  Jordan., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  Yesterday was the deadline that Chairman Gowdy set for the White House Chief of Staff to reply to his questions about security clearances at the White House.  Was that request met?  Did the Chief of Staff send a reply to Chairman Gowdy?, MS. SANDERS:  We’re having conversations with the committee and we’re going to continue working with them.  And I can’t go any further than that at this point., Q    Do you have, at least, the time you think that you might answer the committee?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, we’re in regular conversations with them and we’re going to continue working with them., Trey., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  This week, the President expressed frustration with his Attorney General and the Department of Justice as it relates to the process to look into FISA abuses.  What would the President like to see done differently?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, the President has made clear that he has a lot of concerns, like you said, with the current FISA process.  Nothing makes the problems of FISA cleaner than what was outlined in both the Republican and Democrat memos., The FBI used political campaign material to get a warrant to spy on American citizens.  They failed to disclose to the judge that the dossier was funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, even as it was being used to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  Obviously, that alone shows us that the process needs to be looked at closely and reformed to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect the privacy of American citizens., Q    And as it relates to that tweet, could you elaborate on the relationship between the President and the Attorney General?  Does President Trump believe his Attorney General is disgraceful?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, the President has made his frustrations very clear.  I don’t have anything else to add., Dave., Q    What was the President’s reaction to what the Mayor of Oakland, California, did last weekend when she tipped off residents that there was an imminent immigration raid coming?  Does he feel that the mayor broke the law, and now the Justice Department is looking into that?, MS. SANDERS:  I think it’s outrageous that a mayor would circumvent federal authorities, and certainly put them in danger by making a move such as that.  And that’s currently under review by the Department of Justice, and I don’t have anything else to add., Olivier., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  I got two for you.  First, I know you’re averse to providing details about the tariff plan.  Does the President plan to couple the tariff plan with any policies to mitigate the impact on, say, the auto industry?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I don’t have anything else to add at this point., Q    And, very open ended, did you take note of President Putin’s speech?  And do you have a reaction to his rhetoric and threats about these invincible weapons?, MS. SANDERS:  Yes.  President Putin has confirmed what the United States government has known all along — which Russia has denied — Russia has been developing destabilizing weapons systems for over a decade in direct violations of its treaty obligations., President Trump understands the threats facing America and our allies in this century and is determined to protect our homeland and preserve peace through strength.  U.S. defense capabilities are, and will, remain second to none.  And now, because of the new defense budget of $700 billion, our military will be far stronger than ever.  As the President’s Nuclear Posture Review made clear, America is moving forward to modernize our nuclear arsenal and ensure our capabilities are unmatched., John., Q    Yeah.  Thank you, Sarah.  Two short questions.  First, can you confirm or deny that the President has made a decision to go for the outside for a successor to Hope Hicks as Communications Director, rather than promote from within?, MS. SANDERS:  The decision on that hasn’t been made.  I don’t have a personal announcement., Q    The other thing is that the President has a good relationship with Senators Manchin of West Virginia and Toomey of Pennsylvania.  Has he been in touch with either of them to discuss further the proposed universal gun ban that’s been floated around since last week?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that they were both a part — attended the meeting earlier this week.  The President also spoke, I believe, with Senator Toomey earlier today, but has not seen that final legislation, as discussions are still ongoing.  And so I can’t say where we fall in position on that piece of legislation at this point., But he is continuing to have conversations and is going to continue to be engaged with members of Congress across the board., Francesca., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions was due to be at the White House today for the opioid summit.  Did the President have an opportunity to speak to him while he was here?, MS. SANDERS:  Not that I’m aware of., Q    Okay.  And then moving on to gun violence prevention.  The President said yesterday that he would sign a bill, and then he said, “And I will call whoever you want me to if I like what you’re doing.”  If Senators, if the House, if Congress, passes a bill that does deal with school safety, gun violence, is the President committed to signing whatever they pass?, MS. SANDERS:  The President is not going to unilaterally say without seeing that piece of legislation.  But he does want Congress to come together and put forward a piece of legislation that addresses the safety in schools and gun violence, specifically.  And he laid out a number of things he’d like to see in that, and so we’re hoping that Congress will continue working with us and put a strong piece of legislation forward., I’m going to take one last question.  The President — hey, guys, hold on just a second.  The President is headed over to speak at the opioid summit here momentarily., I’ll take one last question.  Sarah., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  So according to the White House readout, there was a phone call this morning between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and President Trump.  Moon Jae-in briefed him on the inter-Korean talks.  The South Korean government is also saying that they plan to send a special envoy to North Korea soon.  How does the President feel about the dialogue between North and South Korea?  Does he welcome it, or is he concerned?  And does he feel that President Moon is being too soft on North Korea?, MS. SANDERS:  The President wants to continue working with South Korea as a strong ally, and we have no daylight between the two of us.  We’re going to continue those conversations.  Again, the ultimate goal is to denuclearize the Peninsula.  That’s what we’re focused on.  And we’re excited about any steps moving forward in that process., Thanks so much guys.  I’m going to move out.  The President will be speaking here in a couple minutes., END, 3:01 P.M. EST]

       "306  [Westin Book Cadillac Detroit Hotel, \\nDetroit, Michigan, 4:39 P.M. EST, THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Michigan. (Applause.) It is great to be back in Michigan, great to be back in Motor City, U.S.A. (Applause.) And it’s great to be back with so many men and women who elected a President and majorities in Congress who, just two over months ago, enacted historic tax cuts that put America first. (Applause.), And speaking of which, I bring greetings from a man who just loves Michigan and a leader you voted to make the 45th President of the United States of America. I bring greetings from President Donald Trump. (Applause.), We got a lot to talk about today. But before I get started, let me do as your Attorney General just did, and take a moment to address the news out of Central Michigan University today. I know it’s on everyone’s hearts and minds, and it’s on the hearts and minds of people across this country., Now, the facts are still coming in. Our hearts go out to the fallen, to everyone in the Mount Pleasant community that’s been impacted, and especially to the local, state, and federal agencies who are working together, as we speak, on the apprehension and the investigation. We can be proud of the men and women who serve in law enforcement. (Applause.) Thank you., Our hearts are heavy. Another shooting on another campus. It comes in the wake of the terrible shooting that took place at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that claimed the lives of 17 innocent students and teachers, and injured 14 more. There were the terrible attacks in Las Vegas and in Sutherland Springs, where the worst attack on a place of worship in American history took place., You know, as a nation, we mourn with those who mourn, and grieve with those who grieve. And I know I speak on behalf of everyone here when I say that today, and every day, we’re going to continue to pray — continue to pray for all the victims and their families from all of these terrible events., When it comes to our schools, President Trump said it well: “No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school.” (Applause.) Ever. And as the President told the nation’s governors this week at the White House, school safety is now the top priority of the Trump administration. (Applause.), And I’ll make you a promise, Michigan: Working with federal and state leaders, we’re going to strong action to strengthen background checks, to give our schools and law enforcement the resources and flexibility to keep our kids safe. And we’re going to work to give families the tools they need to deal with those struggling with dangerous mental illness., As the President said in a meeting with members of both political parties in the Congress, at the White House, just the day before yesterday, “We have to act” — and we will. We’ve got a lot of work to do. (Applause.), With the President’s leadership, and the support of members of Congress and strong partners in the state, I promise you from my heart: This President, this administration, will not rest until we make our schools safe again. (Applause.) So, thank you for that., And let me also say thank you — thank you for that great introduction and the great leadership and service to the people of Michigan of Attorney General Bill Schuette. (Applause.) I’m honored to be joined by your Attorney General. He’s a man of integrity and great devotion to this state., I’m also, gratefully, joined by an old friend of mine and a great friend of President Trump’s. He’s been an ally of this administration, he’s a tireless champion for the working men and women of Michigan — Congressman Tim Walberg is with us today. (Applause.) And you’ll hear more from him., And finally, I want to thank our host today: an organization that’s working tirelessly to promote the policies that are making a real difference in the lives of Michiganders and in the life of our nation. Join me in thanking America First Policies for bringing us together for this great occasion. (Applause.), You know, it’s great to be back in Michigan and in the great city of Detroit, where people work hard, look out for one another, love this state and this country that we all call home., You know, if President Trump were here with us here today, I have a feeling he’d tell you exactly what he said the last time he was in Michigan. In his words, and I quote, “I love this state, and I love the people the people of Michigan.” That’s what he said, and I agree. (Applause.) So, it’s true., Now, I’m really here today on the President’s behalf, on all of our behalf, first and foremost to say thank you. Thank you, Michigan, for everything you’ve done to stand with our administration — not just in an election in 2016, but every single day since. Because of your support and your hard work in the past year, I’m pleased to report to you the first year of this administration has been a year of action, it’s been a year of results. In a word, it’s been a year of promises made and promises kept. (Applause.) True. Thank you., AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!, THE VICE PRESIDENT: I mean, think about it. President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy. And in just a few short weeks, President Trump is going to sign the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.), He promised to stand with America’s law enforcement. And today, we’re once again giving the men and women on the Thin Blue Line the respect and resources they deserve. (Applause.), And President Trump promised to enforce our laws and secure our borders, and today, illegal crossings on our southern border are down by nearly 50 percent. (Applause.) And I’ll make you a promise: We’re going to build that wall. (Applause.), Beyond our borders, the President promised to restore American leadership and credibility on the world stage. And under President Donald Trump, America once again stands without apology as the leader of the free world. (Applause.), We’ve taken the fight to the terrorists on our terms, on their soil. And thanks to the courage of the Armed Forces of the United States, and the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief, ISIS is on the run, their caliphate has crumbled, and we will not rest or relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source. (Applause.), And we put the leading state sponsor of terror on notice, as well, and made it clear that we will no longer tolerate Iran’s destabilizing activity, and the United States of America will no longer certify the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. (Applause.), And in the wake of their provocations and threats against our nation and our allies, this President has made it clear that when it comes to North Korea, the era of strategic patience is over. (Applause.), And I promise you, the United States of America will continue to stand strong with our allies until North Korea stops threatening our people, threatening our allies, and finally, and lastly, abandons their nuclear and ballistic missile program once and for all. (Applause.), And here at home, the results have been just as dramatic. We’ve taken decisive action to restore the rule of law and rev the engine of the American economy. First off, this President promised to appoint strong conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And as I stand here today, President Trump appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and set a record for the most court of appeal justices in one year in American history. (Applause.) That’s a record of judicial appointments., We promised to unleash the American energy that fuels the Motor City. President Trump approved the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. He rolled back the Clean Power Plan. And President Donald Trump put American manufacturing and America first when he withdrew our nation from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.), We also promised to roll back the heavy hand of government on American free enterprise. In fact, back on the campaign trail, some of you might remember that President Trump said, we’re going to cut two federal regulations for every new regulation that goes on the books. (Applause.), But you know what? After our first year, President Trump has actually eliminated 22 regulations for every new federal rule on the Code of Federal Regulations. (Applause.), We promised to stand up for American workers and American business. And under President Trump’s leadership, we’re also cracking down on unfair trade practices, and we are fighting for trade deals that are fair and reciprocal, and put American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.), And finally, President Trump promised to cut taxes across the board for working families and job creators large and small. And just a little more than two months ago, President Trump, right before Christmas, kept his promise to the American people when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. That’s promises made, promises kept. (Applause.), So in this White House, it’s about strength and growth for our nation and our people, and it’s working. We’re only one year into this administration, and already the results are, frankly, nothing short of remarkable. (Laughter.), You know, I’m from Michigan’s favorite neighbor — (laughter and applause) — the great state of Indiana. And I remember a little bit of friendly competition we had with Michigan and football season. And March Madness is just around the corner. But we also competed for jobs and businesses every single day. While I’ll always be a little partial to the Hoosier State, I got to give it to you, Michigan is leading the American comeback like never before. (Applause.) You are. It’s true., I mean, since Election Day 2016, think about the progress we’re making. Businesses large and small across America have created 2.5 million new jobs, including 58,000 new jobs right here in Michigan in the last year alone. (Applause.), Unemployment hasn’t been this low in 17 years, and more Americans are working today than ever before in our nation’s history. And as the President announced just yesterday, jobless claims are at a 49-year low. (Applause.), Here in the Motor City, unemployment has dropped more than 10 percent since Election Day 2016. And across the state, construction jobs are at a 10-year high., And while thousands of manufacturing jobs disappeared in the last year of the last administration, President Trump promised to fight for the men and women who run our factories, build our cars, and make the nation proud with every product that bears those four beautiful words, as the President calls them: Made in the USA., And after just one year, under President Trump’s leadership, manufacturing in America is back. (Applause.) Amazing. American companies have created nearly 200,000 new, good-paying manufacturing jobs, including nearly 6,000 new jobs across Michigan alone., And after eight years of a stagnant economy, where wages wouldn’t budge, Americans are seeing their paychecks rise faster than any point in nearly a decade, because growth is back, confidence is back, and under President Donald Trump, America is back. (Applause.), But as the President likes to say, at this White House, that’s just what he calls a good start. (Laughter.) The truth is, the best days — the best days for American prosperity, we believe, are yet to come, because those tax cuts are just starting to make a difference. I mean, we cut taxes on working families, giving the typical Michigan family of four $2,300 of their own hard-earned money. We slashed taxes on American businesses so Michigan manufacturers can compete and win more effectively with businesses anywhere in the world. (Applause.), And we didn’t just cut taxes on income and on businesses. We gave the American people the relief they’ve been crying out for: We repealed the Obamacare individual mandate tax. (Applause.) It is gone. Off the books., And it’s working. Since President Trump signed these new tax cuts into law, over 400 companies nationwide have announced more than $480 billion in new investments in American jobs and in American workers., In fact, here in The Motor City, you might have heard Fiat Chrysler is giving out $2,000-tax-cuts bonuses to all of its workers. And they’re going to move their entire production line from Mexico to Michigan, and create 2,500 new good-paying jobs — (applause) — and invest another billion dollars. Let’s hear it for Fiat Chrysler saying yes to America and yes to Michigan. (Applause.) Thank you, Fiat., And as President Trump pledged to the people of this city one year ago, so I say to all of you today: Under our administration, we’ll forge, in his words, a “new future of American automotive leadership.” And it’s happening right before our eyes right here in the car capital of the world. (Applause.), It’s not just America’s automakers that are growing and investing in their workers. In fact, in just the past two months, more than 4.3 million Americans across the nation have already gotten a raise or a bonus thanks to the President’s tax cuts. (Applause.), All told, as businesses continue to invest in their workers, we expect that Michiganders, overall — when all the tax cuts are fully implemented and have their effect — people across this state are going to see their paychecks rise by about $4,000 a year, all because of the tax cut passed by these great leaders in Congress you’ll hear more from later, and the tax law advanced by President Trump., And let me take this moment to thank — thank the leaders in Congress and Michigan who supported this tax cut, including Congressman Walberg and his Michigan colleagues in the House of Representatives for standing strong and putting Michigan first. Give them a round of applause, would you, please? (Applause.), I mean, they voted, in a very real sense — the representatives in Congress from Michigan who voted for this tax cut voted to give Michigan workers a raise. But that can’t be said for the two U.S. senators who represent your state in Washington. Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters voted “no.”, AUDIENCE: Booo —, THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, Debbie Stabenow called tax cuts, “A bad deal for the people of Michigan.” Senator Debbie Stabenow said, “The proof is in your paycheck.” But you know what? You know what? In a way, she’s right. The proof is in your paycheck. (Applause.) Your paychecks are getting bigger because the Trump tax cuts are working for Michigan and they’re working for America. (Applause.), I mean, Michigan families are already paying less in taxes, getting more in raises and bonuses, and bigger benefits. Today, the hardworking men and women of Michigan are reclaiming hope and confidence in a brighter future. And that’s what those tax cuts are all about. And that, sadly, is what both of your senators voted against. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I just think the people of Michigan deserve better in the United States Senate. (Applause.), Be assured, President Trump and I are going to keep fighting for you. We’re going to keep fighting for all the hardworking people across this state, and we’ll always keep putting your interests first., Just a few weeks ago, President Trump unveiled our plan to rebuild America, as well. I don’t know if you noticed, but you elected a builder to be President of the United States. (Laughter.) And under President Trump, we’re going to give the American people the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways and airports in the world. (Applause.) We’re going to rebuild America., And we’re going to keep fighting for trade deals that are free and reciprocal, and that put American workers first. We’re going fix a broken immigration system. We’re going to do it, as the President said, in his words, with “policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.”, Folks, President Trump and I are going to keep making good. We’re going to keep making good on all of the promises that we’ve made to the people of Michigan., AUDIENCE: Thank you! (Applause.), THE VICE PRESIDENT: But, you know, the most important work in America is always done by the American people; not by their elected officials at any level. The most important work of this nation doesn’t take place in the marbled halls of our nation’s capital; it happens in cities just like this one, in towns all across America. The people of this nation are the beating heart of America. And every single one of you, every day, gets the credit for the Michigan comeback and the American comeback. You’re the ones making it happen., You’re the ones around kitchen tables — a parent helping a child with their homework. You’re the ones working the long shifts, like truck drivers and construction workers pulling a double shift, facing a long day’s work just to be able to have hard-earned pride of somebody who helps power the economy of a great nation., You see that greatness and that difference in neighbors helping neighbors every day in places like Detroit, a city that has passed through some challenging times in recent decades. But now, Detroit is emerging stronger and better than ever before. And you’re doing what you’ve done so many times in your long and storied history., You’re a city whose people continue to live up to the Motor City motto, “We hope for better days; it shall rise from the ashes.” You’re a people who continue to inspire the nation with your grit, your character, and your boundless capacity to reinvent yourselves and to renew the American Dream. That’s the Michigan spirit for you., It’s a spirit, I’m told, actually resides in the walls of this very building where we gather today. I guess, when it first opened its doors back in 1924, the Book was the tallest, most state-of-the-art hotel in the world. But like so much that’s happened to this great city in hard times, the Book fell on hard times as well. By the mid-1980s, Hotel Book Cadillac had shut down and fallen into disrepair. You all saw it happen. For more than 20 years, this beautiful building sat empty and abandoned, but it was never forgotten by the people of Detroit., Eventually, the same dream that inspired the Book brothers to build the world’s tallest hotel launched a revitalization of Book-Cadillac in our own day. And 10 years ago, this hotel, the grand lady of Washington Boulevard, reopened its doors and reclaimed its rightful place as the crown jewel of Detroit. (Applause.) That’s the Michigan spirit and that’s the American spirit., It’s a spirit that’s been restoring our country over this last year as well, and even now fills our nation with optimism, hope, and a renewed sense that our best days lie ahead — because they do., So as I close, I want to urge each and every one of you, from everything you hear from this forum today, to go out and talk about Michigan’s renewal and America’s renewal. Talk about it to your friends over a backyard fence outside a CVS. Talk about it at your place of worship and your place of work. I mean, talk about everything they’re not hearing about on cable television. (Laughter and applause.) Are you with me?, I mean, tell them what they’re not hearing about on most of your cable channels. Tell them everything that we’ve accomplished because of the leadership that we’ve elected from the President on down, and how it’s making a real difference in their lives and in the life of this great nation. Tell them we cut their taxes, so they can keep more of what they earn. Tell them we’re restoring American strength at home and abroad, so their families can sleep safe at night., Tell them that we’re putting Washington back to work for them, not the other way around; and that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) You go tell them that. You go tell them that. That’s your part., And in these challenging times of too much division in this great nation, if you’re of a mind, there’s one more thing I’d encourage you to do. Just a few short hours ago, President Trump and I were in Charlotte, North Carolina, where we had the chance to bid farewell to one of the greatest Americans of the past century, the Reverend Billy Graham. (Applause.), Billy Graham was a man of towering faith, whose ministry for the Gospel and his matchless voice transformed countless lives, inspired our nation, and changed the world. His message transcended politics. It sprung from what has always been, I believe, for millions of Americans what Billy Graham called a “hope for the present and hope for the future.”, So today, I encourage you, if you share that same conviction, I encourage you to take advantage, any opportunity you have, to bow the head and bend the knee, and pray for our country. (Applause.) Pray for all those who serve in uniform at home and abroad. Pray for all of us that have the privilege — the privilege in this great nation to serve the people of the United States., And when you pray, pray with confidence. Because I really do believe those ancient words inscribed a millennia ago are still as true today as they ever were — that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll hear from heaven and He’ll heal this land. (Applause.) This one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all., So thank you for the opportunity to spend some time with you on a Friday afternoon after a long —, AUDIENCE: Thank you! (Applause.), THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I just want to promise you: With the continued support of every one of you in this room and the good people of Michigan, with the strong support of our partners in Congress who are standing with this President every day to put America first, with President Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I know we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. (Applause.), Thank you very much. God Bless you. Thank you, Michigan., END 5:09 P.M.

       "307  [The Greenbrier Resort, \\nWhite Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, 6:44 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Jim.  (Applause.)  That is a great gentleman.  And he’s a big man, isn’t he?  He’s a big man.  Big Jim.  And thank you to Cathy, very much, it’s an honor.  Please sit down.  Thank you very much., West Virginia is truly blessed to have someone like the governor and wonderful first lady.  And I just want to say that I love this state, which I happened to win by 42 points over a Democrat.  (Applause.)  Forty-two points.  That’s like one of these genius golfers winning by nine, you know?  It’s like the same thing., But I want to thank everybody.  I spent the last three days interviewing and thinking about Supreme Court Justices, such an important decision.  And we’re going to give you a great one.  We’re going to announce it on Monday.  And I think you’ll be very impressed.  These are very talented people.  Brilliant people.  And think you’re going to really love it, like Justice Gorsuch.  We hit a home run there and we’re going to hit a home run here.  And, step by step, we are making America great again.  (Applause.), So Jim asked me to do this.  I mean, you know, he did switch from Democrat to Republican.  You don’t see that often.  (Laughter.)  So it’s hard for me to say, “No, I’m not coming.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “I’m coming, Jim.”  And it’s a beautiful place.  And I watch these tournaments.  I have such respect for these golfers; these great, talented — nobody knows how good they are.  They’re really talented athletes., But we’re gathered here on the eve of the 4th of July to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible, our brave servicemembers and our wonderful veterans.  We love our veterans.  (Applause.)  Love our veterans., For 242 years — it’s a long time — American independence has endured because of the sweat, blood, and sacrifice of the American armed forces.  We’d be — yeah, you’ve probably been hearing, we may add a little thing called “Space Force.”  We have Air Force — “Space Force.”  (Applause.)  I don’t know if anybody wants to hear that.  But we’re thinking very seriously about it because space is becoming very important militarily, as well as other reasons.  But it’s the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world., During both the Civil War and the World War II, the Greenbrier served as a hospital for wounded soldiers, so it’s so appropriate.  Tonight at the Greenbrier’s first annual Salute to Service dinner, we’re calling upon this rich history, and we’re carrying no the PGA’s proud legacy of supporting America’s heroes., Joining us for tonight’s ceremony are many incredible golfers who will be competing at the Greenbrier this week.  And I’ll be sitting home at the White House and I’ll be watching and saying, “I wish I could play like that.”  (Laughter.), Among those with us — I just said hello to a few of them — Bubba Watson.  He’s having a good year.  Where’s Bubba?  Where is he?  Boy, Bubba.  (Applause.)  He is having a good year.  Thank you, Bubba., Keegan Bradley.  Keegan.  Great.  (Applause.)  Thanks, Keegan.  Thanks.  Thanks, Keegan.  That putter is working.  I just said, “That shorter putter’s okay.”  (Laughter.), Longest hitter I’ve ever seen, big John Daly.  John?  (Applause.)  John.  Boy, he’s — John, I played with John in a tournament that we won — meaning that he won.  (Laughter.)  He won.  You know, it’s funny, he won and then I go back.  Everyone said, “How’d you do?”  “I won.”  (Laughter.)  Right, John?  He’s something., And Phil Mickelson.  Phil, I’ll tell you.  (Applause.)  I’ll never forget, I was at — this is — I don’t think Phil can remember this, but like, 15 — where’s Phil?  Where is that guy?  He’s so incredible., But it was about 15 years ago, and I was “Donald,”  and I’m watching, and the place is packed with people.  And Phil’s there, and he sees me, and I’ve liked Phil.  And Phil, I think, likes me.  And he’s on the third hole and it’s a big deal, a big tournament.  And he said, “Oh, excuse me, just a second.”  And he gets up, hits a ball — it was a three wood — he hits a three wood, like 280 [yards] right down the middle.  Then he comes back, “Okay, good.  So how’s everything else?”  (Laughter.)  And I said, “That really is special talent.”  That’s the office, Phil, right?  That’s just the office.  So it’s really amazing.  What a great career.  What a great gentleman., I really want to thank Jim Nantz for leading this evening’s program.  Jim, wherever you may be.  Where’s Jim?  (Applause.)  There’s a great, great job.  Hi, Jim.  Great job, Jim.  Really good., And Slugger White.  He keeps everybody honest, right?  Where is Slugger?  Slugger has done a fantastic job.  Nobody plays games with Slugger.  (Applause.)  I know, at Doral, I tried to move the tees back, and I — he couldn’t, he just wouldn’t let me do it.  (Laughter.)  There was no doubt about it.  Right, Slugger?  Slugger is great., And all of the PGA officials, tournament staff, and the volunteers for their incredibly hard work in putting this really incredible event together.  And the job that Jim Justice has done with the course is really spectacular., Also, with us this evening, is acting VA Secretary — he’s doing a phenomenal job at the Veteran’s Administration — Peter O’Rourke — Peter?  Peter?  (Applause.)  Good job, Peter.  Done a lot of work at the VA., Along with West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito — who’s a good golfer, by the way.  (Applause.)  Shelley.  Good golfer, Shelley., And Congressmen Alex Mooney and Morgan Griffith.  Where are they?  (Applause.)  Great.  Thanks, fellas.  Tremendous help to me, getting things passed.  You think it’s easy in Congress.  Not easy.  That’s why I have the great — if I didn’t introduce them as an example today, they’d never vote for me again.  (Laughter.)  That’d be the end of your taxes.  That would be the end of everything., I also want to thank our great Attorney General from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey — (applause) — who is fighting a great grace.  Patrick?  And congratulations to Patrick, running for the U.S. Senate.  And he is a tough, strong guy.  And he ran an incredible race against some very talented people, and he won.  And now he’s got another race and it’s going to be — I see the polls have it very close.  You may be surprised to see what’s going to happen.  He’s got incredible energy, incredible strength, and he loves the people of West Virginia, like, a lot.  So good luck, Patrick.  We’re proud of you.  Great job.  (Applause.), Speaker Tim Armstead and Majority Whip Carol Miller.  I want to thank you very much for being here.  And Carol, good luck in the race.  I know you’re going to do well.  I know you’re going to do well.  (Applause.), And we’re honored to have with us the Adjutant General of West Virginia, Major General James Hoyer of the National Guard.  The “Big Cheese.”  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, General.  Thank you very much., Tomorrow, families across our nation will gather to celebrate the 4th of July.  As we do, we will think of the men and women serving overseas at this very moment — far away, far, far away from their families — protecting America and watching over our people.  They are there, and they are with us, and they are brave.  These are incredible people., And we will thank God for blessing us with these unbelievable heroes.  To everyone here tonight that has served our nation in uniform, will you please stand so we can express our gratitude?  Please stand.  Please.  (Applause.), Tough cookies.  Tough cookies.  And you know, when it comes to ICE, and Border Patrol, and all of these incredible people that you’ve been reading about who are doing an unreal job, we want border security, we want security in our country.  We respect ICE., You know, ICE is the one.  These are tough people.  And you have to be tough.  And when they have a problem with MS-13 gangs and all of these others that came in through these horrible and weak immigration laws that, Shelley, we’re strengthening up — we’re going to get them done.  We need tough laws.  We need fair laws.  (Applause.), But when these people come into our country and come in illegally, and then they’re dispersed throughout the country, and all of a sudden you see nests of MS-13 — you know, it’s like you’re liberating towns.  We sent ICE in.  And for ICE, it’s just another day.  Like Phil and John and Keegan, all of the guys, and Bubba — like the way they play golf:  They go; they play.  They don’t know.  It’s hard.  They don’t know what that is., These guys, they walk into those areas, they take them out of there so fast.  They’re not afraid of anything.  It is — it’s like you’re liberating a town.  Like in a war, you’re liberating a town or an area.  And ICE goes in there, and they go in there, and sometimes they have to go in swinging.  They don’t mind.  They’re tough., And then I hear Democrats saying, “We want to abandon ICE.  We want to abandon.”  We’re not abandoning ICE.  And we’re not abandoning our law enforcement.  (Applause.)  Just the opposite., So I want to recognize, today, a legendary hero from West Virginia, a veteran who fought in Iwo Jima.  In February of 1945, he volunteered to dash straight into enemy fire to destroy vital enemy fortifications and to clear a path for American forces to continue forward.  He went right into the machine gun nests.  John Daly wouldn’t do that, and he’s a pretty tough (inaudible).  John, would you do that?  I don’t think so.  Definitely hurt your golf game, John.  That’s the end of golf.  (Laughter.), In the face of bullets and bayonets, he risked his life for his brothers-in-arms, and he earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.  (Applause.), Today, Woody Williams is 94 years old.  He has dedicated his life to supporting Gold Star families and building memorials to honor our fallen servicemembers.  In 2016, thousands were moved by Woody’s patriotic words when he spoke at one of our rallies in West Virginia.  He was incredible.  I still remember it.  And of course, we all remember that wonderful moment when Woody flipped the coin at this year’s Super Bowl., Woody, you are a national treasure, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  (Applause.)  Woody, where are — where is Woody?  Where is Woody?  Thank you, Woody.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Woody., Brave man.  Ninety-four.  I give a lot of Congressional Medals of Honor.  When I say a lot, probably five so far.  And it’s really one of my greatest honors to do it.  The Congressional Medal of Honor.  It’s our highest honor.  Woody, fantastic.  So often I’m giving them posthumously where they’re just not around.  But we hear the stories, and their families are there, and everyone is proud.  But every once and a while, we have one that can be given to people that are living, like you, Woody.  So thank you very much., We’re also deeply moved and honored to be joined by a Gold Star Spouse who knows the true price of freedom, Christine Pusateri.  Christine’s husband, Chris, was a Sergeant in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.  Great group.  Chris was killed in action in Iraq in 2005., Christine, tonight we send the love and gratitude of our entire nation.  Your husband was a special man.  We will hold you and your precious family in our hearts forever.  Christine, where are you?  Christine.  Christine.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Christine.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Christine., And, Christine, through your husband’s heroic sacrifice, you understand that he has achieved immortality.  And our debt to him, and to you, is eternal and everlasting.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, darling., From Bunker Hill to the beaches of Normandy and the jungles of Vietnam, Americans in every generation have given their last breath, their last measure of love, and their final moments on this Earth in defense of their country and their countrymen., Our servicemembers have fulfilled their duty to America a million times over.  Now, we must fulfill our sacred duty to them.  We must protect those who protect us., When our servicemembers are in uniform, it is our obligation to ensure that they have the finest equipment, the finest training, care, resources — better than any military on Earth.  And when our servicemembers return to civilian life as veterans, we must ensure they have access to the best care, treatment, and support in the world., We are restoring American security by rebuilding our great military.  We have secured, this year — with the help of Shelley and your great Congressman — a record $700 billion for our military.  And next year, $716 billion — most amount ever.  We’re rebuilding our military., And when have we needed it more?  Outside of wars themselves, when?  Think about it.  And we’re building it so big, so powerful, so strong.  Stronger than we’ve ever been.  And hopefully, we’ll never have to use it., And as the golfers can tell you, the stronger we get, the less likely it is that we will have to use it.  But we’ll be at a point, the likes of which we’ve never been as a power.  And again, hopefully never having to use that incredible equipment that is built right here.  Best in the world, in the U.S.A.  (Applause.), We also gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in eight years.  So they got a pay raise.  And it was about time.  They’ve been waiting for a long time.  (Applause.), And I’m proud, that under my Administration, we’ve passed the largest VA reforms in half a century.  I signed into law, just recently, the VA Accountability legislation.  And just so you understand, accountability — you couldn’t fire anybody in the VA.  They could be sadists.  They could be late.  They could be bad.  They could have lots of problems.  They could talk back to you.  You couldn’t do a thing., For 40 years, they’ve been trying to get it passed, and we got it passed.  It’s called VA Accountability.  And as I’ve said before, we now look at the person that violates our great veterans, and we say, “Jim, get the hell out of here.  You’re fired.”  (Applause.), And we can do it.  Now, we can do it.  You couldn’t (inaudible).  If they’re no good — and if they’re good, we reward.  We have a lot of great people., As promised, we opened the White House VA Hotline, and have instituted new transparency on wait times and quality of care.  We are processing veteran claims more quickly than ever before.  We’re expanding healthcare, so that our great veterans can get care anywhere, and at anytime., And maybe most importantly — I don’t know, accountability is important, but this is another one.  I used to be very proud of myself when I’d be on the campaign trail, and I’d say, “You know, why don’t they just pay a doctor to take care?”  Because, as you know, sometimes veterans will stand on line for days and days, for weeks., Can you imagine Phil Mickelson going to the doctor, and they’ll say, “Good, he should be there in about 12 days”?  Twelve days.  That’s not acceptable, Phil.  Right?  It’s not acceptable., So what we’re doing is — now, if there’s a wait, if there’s a problem, you’re going to a doctor that might be right across the street.  You’re going to get taken care of immediately., People would wait so long; you’d wait weeks.  You’d stand on line.  You’d literally come back day after day.  So now we have what’s called “VA Choice.”  And I used to say, “Why don’t they do that?”  I didn’t know anything.  I thought I was totally brilliant.  I thought this was the greatest idea.  Then I went to tell people about it, and they said, “Yeah, we’ve been trying to get that passed for years.”, So I was very good at getting it passed because we got it passed three weeks ago.  So now you have VA Choice where if you have to wait, you go to a doctor, we pay the doctor.  (Applause.)  So it’s great, and we’re very proud of that.  And we’re very proud of what’s happening at the VA., In order to maintain our security as a nation, we understand that we must have economic strength as well.  And nobody believes it; if I would have said it, they would have said, “What a horrible thing to say, what an exaggeration.”  The fake news — they’re all back there.  They’re all back there.  (Laughter.), If I would have shot a 75, they’d say, “There’s no way he could do it.  There’s no way.”  (Laughter.)  They might be right about that, actually.  (Laughter.), But they are back there.  They would have said there’s no way — 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day.  They would have said, “No way.”  They would have said, and a lot of people would have said.  (Applause.), Unemployment claims are at the lowest point in 44 years.  That means people are working again.  (Applause.)  African American unemployment is in the lowest it’s ever been.  The history of our country — it’s at the lowest in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  Remember I used to say “What do you have to lose?  Vote for Trump.  What do you have to lose?”, Hispanic American unemployment, the lowest in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  By the way, women — I was saying, two weeks ago, “21 years.”  Now, I’m saying, “66 years.”  I think, within two weeks, I’ll be saying “the lowest in history.”  The lowest unemployment in 66 years.  (Applause.), Last year, in West Virginia, per capita personal income grew more than 40 percent faster than the national average.  Coal exports — you remember I said “Coal.  Coal.  Clean coal.”  Jim, clean coal.  Right?  We always say “clean coal.”  And what they can do now is incredible with coal.  Clean coal exports skyrocketed by more than 60 percent nationwide, and I’m so proud of that., When we came here, I met with the miners.  And I talked to the miners, and I talked to (inaudible) about different way of life.  They didn’t want to hear about it.  They love digging coal.  That’s what they like.  They love — their grandfathers, their fathers, their families.  And coal is coming back., And it’s also coming back for another reason: national security.  And your governor knows very well, and your senator knows very well what that means with coal.  You know, you bomb a pipeline, that’s the end of the pipeline.  With coal, that stuff is indestructible.  (Laughter and applause.), You can move it around on a truck, you can dump it at the plant, you can do whatever the hell — you can rain on top of it for a long time.  Right, Jim?  It can rain like crazy.  You can do whatever you want — snow, sleet, wind.  You just dump it.  It’s there.  You hit those pipelines, they’re gone, and that’s the end of it.  You’re saying, “Man, we better go out and start cutting some lumber.”  (Laughter.)  So for national security purposes, I don’t think people talk about it enough — coal., America is winning again because we’re finally putting America first.  We’re putting our country first.  Tomorrow, we commemorate 242 years since our forefathers adopted the Declaration of Independence., In their quest to become a sovereign nation, they knew they would have to defeat the most powerful military on land or on sea.  They knew that.  They knew that, as they met, thousands upon thousands of British troops were disembarking outside of New York City, preparing to crush the revolution.  They were going to crush it quickly.  They weren’t even actually taking it seriously., These patriots knew that their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor were on the line.  They risked it all for the promise of more of a just and better future.  They wanted this great future in this incredible land.  They made the same brave choice as countless others who followed in the generations after them: the choice to stand strong for their families, their principles, their pride, and their God-given rights., Every time we see an American in uniform, any time we have the chance to shake the hand of a veteran, and whenever we hear the stories of our warriors, we are reminded how truly blessed we are to be American and to live in this land of our great heroes — you.  Our great heroes., This 4th of July, let us pledge to renew the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as Americans.  Let us pledge to expand the blessings of liberty, prosperity, and justice to all of our citizens.  And let us always remember that we are one people and one nation, saluting one great American flag.  (Applause.), I want to thank you — to every one of these incredible athletes that are here today.  These are PGA players.  These are unbelievably talented people.  They’re talented in their mind and in their body.  Their muscles are strong, but their mind has to be stronger.  It’s tough.  And these are tough people.  These are incredible people.  So I want to thank all of you for being here tonight.  It’s an honor for me, especially as a golfer.  (Applause.)  It’s an honor for me., I want to thank Big Jim Justice.  Stand up, Big Jim, come on.  (Applause.) He’s about 6’10 and he weighs about — I’m not going to say 450; I won’t do that to you, Jim.  But he’s a big man, and he’s done a great job., Do you know that West Virginia is second in the nation in the percentage increase of GDP?  Think of what that means.  (Applause.)  And Jim just said, “Before we met Trump, that number was not good.”  Pretty close to last, right?  And combinations of a lot of good people with Shelley, and you, and us., But now, think of that.  Texas was first.  Texas.  Doing a great job.  Great governor there, too.  But Texas was first.  West Virginia was second — percentage increase of GDP.  That’s an incredible accomplishment in a short period of time.  Incredible.  (Applause.), I want to thank everyone at the Greenbrier for making this tournament a beautiful tribute to our military.  And thanks again to all of the veterans here tonight, and all across America.  We love you, we thank you, and we will never, ever forget you., God bless our Veterans.  God bless America.  And Happy Independence Day to all.  Thank you very much.  This is a great honor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.), END, 7:10 P.M.

       "308  [Roosevelt Room, \\n2:35 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  Big day.  Very important day.  We have a lot of important days at our White House.  And this is, to me, the future., I want to thank you all for being here to discuss a critical issue for our country’s future: winning the race to be the world’s leading provider of 5G cellular communications networks.  It’s all about 5G now.  We were at 4G, and everybody was saying, “We have to get 4G.”  And then they said, before that, “We have to get 3G.”  And now we have to get 5G, and 5G is a big deal.  And that’s going to be there for a while.  And I guess, at some point, we’ll be talking to you about number 6.  What do you think?  (Laughter.)  Do you think that’s true, Ajit?, But, right now, we want to be the leader in this.  We’re the leader in almost everything else., And we’re grateful to be joined by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who’s been doing a fantastic job, and Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky.  Thank you very much, Stephen.  Appreciate it.  And tell Sonny “hello.”  He’s doing a tremendous job.  Really tremendous., Secure 5G networks will absolutely be a vital link to America’s prosperity and national security in the 21st century., \\n5G will be as much as 100 times faster than the current 4G cellular networks.  It will transform the way our citizens work, learn, communicate, and travel.  It will make American farms more productive, American manufacturing more competitive, and American healthcare better and more accessible.  Basically, it covers almost everything, when you get right down to it.  Pretty amazing., And just as 4G networks paved the way for smartphones and all of the exciting breakthroughs — they made possible so many things — this will be more secure and resilient.  5G networks will also create astonishing and really thrilling new opportunities for our people — opportunities that we’ve never even thought we had a possibility of looking at., We cannot allow any other country to out-compete the United States in this powerful industry of the future.  We are leading by so much in so many different industries of that type, and we just can’t let that happen.  The race to 5G is a race America must win, and it’s a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in.  We’ve given them the incentive they need.  It’s a race that we will win., In the United States, our approach is private-sector driven and private-sector led.  The government doesn’t have to spend lots of money.  According to some estimates, the wireless industry plans to invest $275 billion in 5G networks, creating 3 million American jobs quickly — very quickly — and adding $500 billion to our economy., And, as you probably heard, we had another alternative of doing it; that would be through government investment.  And leading through the government, we don’t want to do that because it won’t be nearly as good, nearly as fast.  And especially in that business, I think that they’ll be better doing the job than a lot of the folks who we know and love., To accelerate and incentivize these investments, my administration is focused on freeing up as much wireless spectrum as needed — we’re going to free it up so they’ll be able to get out there and get it done — and removing regulatory barriers to the buildout of networks., As Chairman Pai will discuss with you in a moment, the FCC is taking very bold action — probably bolder than they’ve ever taken before; it’s a new frontier — to make wireless spectrum available.  By next year, the United States is on pace to have more 5G spectrum than any other country in the world.  That’s a big statement because, as you know, some people got ahead of us.  We should have been doing this a long time ago, as advanced as it may be., In addition, last October, I directed the Department of Commerce to develop a National Spectrum Strategy to free up even more spectrum for economic activity, including 5G., The FCC has also taken action to streamline the permitting process for 5G infrastructure with state and local governments.  That’s a big deal.  It takes too long to get permits.  We’re going to free that situation up, and we’re going to put limits and the local areas are going to listen to us very, very strongly.  They have a big incentive to do that., They must now approve new physical infrastructure within 90 days, instead of many years.  It can sometimes take three, four, and five years.  We’re going to put a limit of 90 days.  And there is now a cap on the unreasonable fees local governments often charge.  They get greedy.  They think, “Hey, we can really take advantage.”  And it ends up that everybody gets hurt.  So we’re putting a cap on those fees.  These changes will contribute greatly to building high-speed networks across America.  And it’s going to happen very quickly.  Very, very quickly., By the end of this year, the United States will have 92 5G deployments in markets nationwide.  The next nearest country, South Korea, will have 48.  So we have 92, compared to 48.  And we’re going to accelerate that pace greatly., But we must not rest; the race is far from over.  American companies must lead the world in cellular technology.  5G networks must be secure.  They must be strong.  They have to be guarded from the enemy — we do have enemies out there — and they will be.  They must cover every community, and they must be deployed as soon as possible., As we are making great progress with 5G, we’re also focused on rural communities that do not have access to broadband at all.  And we have a couple of people from the great farms that I love, that I’m sure voted for me.  I won’t ask them, but they seem — (laughter) — I think they, for the most part — yes?, PARTICIPANT:  Yeah., THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I think, for the most part, they did.  I think — I know that almost automatically.  I’d be very surprised., But I have to say, I’ve been talking about broadband for the — for rural America — the farmers and others.  They have really been — they just haven’t been treated properly.  And now, what we’re doing is we’re making it a priority.  That’s the areas we want to go to first, so they’re covered., We’re working closely with federal agencies to get networks built in rural America faster and at much, much lower cost than it is even today., So now I’d like to introduce a very special man who’s really worked hard and gained the respect of the world, truly — because they see what we’re doing in our country — who will making two major announcements to accelerate our 5G future and extend broadband access to every American., No matter where you are, you will have access to 5G.  And it’s going to be a different life.  I don’t know that it’s going to be better.  Maybe you’re happy the way it is right now — (laughter) — but I can say, technologically, it won’t even be close., So, Chairman Pai, thank you very much.  Please, say a few words., Thank you very much, Ajit., MR. PAI:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Appreciate you.  (Applause.), Well, thank you, Mr. President, for you your compelling vision of U.S. leadership on 5G.  I also want to thank Larry Kudlow, the Director of the National Economic Council, for your steadfast support of this vision., Mr. President, as you observed, America must win the race to 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity.  And this matters for two key reasons:, The first is national competitiveness.  We want the good-paying jobs that develop and deploy 5G technologies — jobs that support some of the folks in this room — to be created here, in America.  We want these technologies to give our economy a leg up as we compete against the rest of the world., The second reason U.S. leadership matters is that 5G will improve Americans’ lives in so many ways, from precision agriculture, to smart transportation networks, to telemedicine, and more.  We want Americans to be the first to benefit from this new digital revolution while protecting our innovators and our citizens.  And as you pointed out, Mr. President, we don’t want rural Americans to be left behind., And, Mr. President, that’s why I’m pleased to report that America is now well positioned to win the race to fast, secure, and reliable 5G.  And don’t just take my word for it.  In February, ABI Research stated, and I quote, “It is the United States who will win the 5G race in the short term.”  That same month, Cisco projected that, in three years, 5G would be more than twice as prevalent in North America as in Asia., Last week, CTIA reported that America leads the world with the most commercial 5G deployments of any nation., And just this past Tuesday, it was reported that 5G-related job listings here in the United States increased 12 percent in just the past three weeks according to data from an online job search service., Today, 5G is a success story — an American success story.  Well, how are we getting the job done?  As the lead agency on 5G, the FCC is pursuing a three-part strategy called the 5G FAST Plan.  First, we’re freeing up spectrum, the invisible airwaves that carry wireless traffic.  We finished our first 5G spectrum auction in January, and we’re holding a second, right now, that has already generated almost $2 billion in bids., Second, we’re making it easier to install wireless infrastructure.  5G will rely heavily on a web of small antennas.  But when I came into office, regulations designed for tall towers threatened to strangle our 5G future in red tape.  We have eliminated these rules, because infrastructure the size of a pizza box shouldn’t have to jump through the same regulatory hoops as a 200-foot cell tower., And third, we’ve taken action to encourage the deployment of optical fiber.  That is because 5G isn’t just about wireless.  We’ll also need strong fiber networks to carry 5G traffic once it goes from the air to the ground.  And we’ve done a lot to make that happen, including ending heavy-handed regulations imposed by the prior administration., And here, too, we are getting results.  Last year, fiber was deployed to more new locations in the United States than in any year before.  But in the race to 5G, our early success is still early.  We still need to do more, and we will., And so today I’m announcing two new steps the FCC will take to build on our momentum.  First, the FCC intends to start its third 5G spectrum auction on December 10th of this year.  This will be the largest spectrum auction in American history.  We will be selling 3,400 megahertz in three different bands.  And for those of you who aren’t wireless experts, that is a lot of spectrum., Second, to help build the infrastructure of the future, the FCC aims to create a $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund headed by the agency.  This money will extend high-speed broadband to up to 4 million homes and small businesses in rural America.  These next-generation networks will bring greater economic opportunity to America’s heartland, including some of the great jobs building infrastructure, and they will help support future 5G technologies., In closing, I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for your leadership on 5G.  Your White House has advanced your vision in many ways, from international treaty negotiations to much-needed regulatory reforms.  I appreciate all these efforts, and in the same spirit, this FCC will help build a great and lasting legacy of American success on 5G., Thank you, Mr. President., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Ajit.  Very good.  (Applause.), Ivanka worked very hard on this.  Maybe say a couple of words, Ivanka?  Please., MS. TRUMP:  Sure.  Well, thank you.  And thank you, everyone, for being here today.  Obviously, American dominance in the industries of the future is predicated on connectivity and digital connectivity.  And 5G is the future., And so I think everyone in this room feels very comfortable to know it’s in your very capable hands.  And, President, we thank you for your leadership on this critical issue., And I’m so glad that we were able to include in today’s discussion our priorities on rural broadband.  So that is something that, from the earliest days of the administration, we’ve sought to really deliver on.  And with today’s announcement, in addition to the milestones that have been achieved over the last two years, we can say that we’re bringing 5G and rural broadband across this country., So, really, thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, honey.  (Applause.), Would you like to say something on behalf of the farmers and our great people?  Please., MR. SMITH:  Certainly.  Mr. President, we really appreciate the fact that you have put this emphasis on rural America., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right., MR. SMITH:  The things that you have done in office have been tremendous for us.  We look forward to the next several years of you continuing to do that., The thing that you struck today, though, of deregulation, broadening it out, and letting the American business, letting the American farmers and ranchers fix the problems of this country, really rings hard with us.  That’s what we try to do and that’s what we’ll take forward to build this nation., Thank you for your help., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.), MR. MILLER:  Mr. President, Chairman Pai, on behalf of the National Association of Tower Erectors, our 900-member companies, we build, deploy, and maintain the wireless infrastructure of this nation.  And you all are fixing to put us to work, and we appreciate it.  (Laughter and applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  And your people do an incredible job, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  What a great job., And they go up high.  How high do you go?, MR. RAY:  I’ve been up 800-foot., THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And somebody said 200 feet and sometimes more.  That’s a long way up., And you feel very safe, right?  Huh?  Who said 200? (Laughter.), MR. MASSENGALE:  A thousand., THE PRESIDENT:  A thousand?  Come here.  Come here., PARTICIPANT:  That’s a big tower., THE PRESIDENT:  Come here.  (Laughter and applause.), How high do you go?, MR. MASSENGALE:  Up to 1,000 feet., THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want that job.  (Laughter.), Thank you very much.  Thank you all very much.  I appreciate it.  This is going to be a great, great thing., Q    Mr. President — Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah., Q    — can you tell us your plans about sanctuary cities and illegal migrants?  (Inaudible.), THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, the people that are putting sanctuary cities where they’re not even wanted — because as you know, in California and other places, a lot of communities want to get out of sanctuary cities; they don’t want them.  But they always seem to have open arms., So we thought rather than moving the illegal immigrants to other parts of the country — first of all, we’re getting them and we’re doing the best we can with very bad laws.  We have to change the laws.  But we’re apprehending thousands and thousands of people a day, and the law only allows us to hold them, as you know, for 20 days because of the most ridiculous laws, probably, we have in this country., If Ajit had laws like that for 5G, you wouldn’t have anything built.  You’d never have the first cell put up., But we have horrible, old-fashioned laws that are put in by the Democrats.  We’re willing to change them.  We can do it in — I used to say 45 minutes; we can do it in 15 minutes — whether it’s catch and release or chain migration or any of them., The asylum laws are absolutely insane.  They come up.  In many cases, they’re rough gang members.  In many cases, they’re people with tremendous crime records and they’re given a statement to read by lawyers that stand there waiting for them, “Read this statement.”  And it says, “I have great fear for my life.  I have great fear for being in my country.”  Even though, in some cases, some of these people are holding their country’s flags and waving their country’s flags.  And then they talk about the fear they have of being in the country — that the flag they were waving freely., So we are looking at the possibility — strongly looking at it, to be honest with you.  California, the governor wants to have a lot of people coming in, refugees coming in.  A lot of sanctuary cities.  So we’ll give them to the sanctuary cities, maybe, to take care of, if that’s the way they want it — because we can only hold them, under the current law, for 20 days.  So we apprehend them by the thousands and thousands a day., I have to say Border Patrol has been incredible.  The job they’re doing is incredible.  The wall is going up.  It’s going up fairly rapidly.  We’re doing another big section.  We start another big section tomorrow.  But we’re building miles and miles of wall., And we’re going to have — I think we’ll be close to 400 miles built by the end of next year.  We need that.  Just got back from Texas, and some of the ranchers told me — you look at Brooks County, you look at other places — some of the ranchers told me you have bodies lying all over the land of people where the coyotes give them a can of soda and they give them a sandwich and they say, “Houston is 300 miles in that direction.”  And the people don’t know what that means.  That means they can’t make it.  That means they have no chance and they die.  It’s something I never heard.  I never heard it to this extent.  Many people die.  And they’ll say, “Just head in that direction.”, And we are doing a lot about it.  If we had the wall, we wouldn’t have that.  If we had the wall, people wouldn’t be coming up.  Mexico is now apprehending and bringing back to the various countries that we’re talking about — Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador — they’re bringing people back to those countries; Colombia, to a certain extent — and they’re going back to those countries., But we could fix that and so fast if the Democrats would agree.  But if they don’t agree, we might as well do what they always say they want: We’ll bring the illegal — really, you call them the “illegals.”  I call them the “illegals.”  They came across the border illegally.  We’ll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it, whether it’s a state or whatever it might be., California certainly is always saying, “Oh, we want more people.”  And they want more people in their sanctuary cities.  Well, we’ll give them more people.  We can give them a lot.  We can give them an unlimited supply.  And let’s see if they’re so happy.  They say, “We have open arms.”  They’re always saying they have open arms.  Let’s see if they have open arms., The alternative is to change the laws, and we can do it very, very quickly, very easily.  Okay?  Okay?, Q    Are you asking for more troops on the border as well?, THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to put more troops on the border, yeah.  We’re going to.  And, you know, the thing is, our country is doing so well economically.  We’re setting records that a lot of people are coming up for that reason.  A lot of people are coming up for bad reasons too., We have a lot of very, very bad people with big criminal records trying to get through.  And the Border Patrol has done an incredible job with them.  Those are our focus.  They really have done a really incredible job.  And when they have been through, and when they’ve been let through over the years — ICE — all over Long Island — and they come and they get them and they take them back, and we get them the hell out of here., That’s happening all over our country.  ICE.  But the job that ICE and that, really, Border Patrol does is an incredible job.  And law enforcement in this country is — the job they’re doing is really incredible., You know, I don’t know if you saw the crime stats, but the statistics are that crime is way down in our country over the last year.  Way, way down.  And so that’s despite all of the problems we have at the border.  And we’re straightening that out., So, on sanctuary cities, as per your question, we are giving very strong consideration to having people — after a 20-day period — because, again you’re not allowed, legally, to hold them for more than that — we will move them into sanctuary cities., Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you., END                 2:57 P.M.

       "309  [South Lawn, 8:10 A.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  We just had news that Turkey released a prisoner that we were trying to get, and they released him a little while ago into home custody and will be released from home custody to the United States pretty soon.  And I just want to thank President Erdoğan.  We dealt with that, and he was — it was great., They released this prisoner, hostage — whatever you want to call him.  He’s at home custody, in Turkey.  He’ll be released fairly soon, so that’s good news.  I guess, probably, you know about that., Other than that, I think things are going very well.  The economy is doing fantastically well, beyond any expectation.  Unemployment numbers are just about the best in the history of our country.  Employment numbers are the best.  We have close to 160 million people working today, which is more than we’ve ever had before., I’m going out to Colorado today to give the commencement address for the Air Force, which is actually very exciting for me.  It’s an amazing place.  These are great people.  So I look forward to doing that., Any questions?, Q    What did you make of Mueller’s statement yesterday?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it was the same as the report.  There wasn’t much change. It was, to me, the same as the report.  And there’s no obstruction.  You see what we’re saying.  There’s no obstruction, there’s no collusion, there’s no nothing.  It’s nothing but a witch hunt.  This is a witch hunt by the media and the Democrats.  They’re partners., And it keeps going.  I thought it was finished when the report was released, but it goes on.  And, to me, it was the same, frankly, as the report.  And he said, basically, it was the same as the report., Q    Do you still think Robert Mueller behaved honorably?, THE PRESIDENT:  I think he’s totally conflicted.  Because, as you know, he wanted to be the FBI Director, and I said no.  As you know, I had a business dispute with him.  After he left the FBI, we had a business dispute.  Not a nice one.  He wasn’t happy with what I did, and I don’t blame him.  But I had to do it because that was the right thing to do.  But I had a business dispute., And he loves Comey.  You look at the relationship with those two.  So whether it’s love or deep like, but he was conflicted., Look, Robert Mueller should’ve never been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he didn’t get it.  And the next day, he was picked as Special Counsel.  So you tell somebody, “I’m sorry, you can’t have the job.”  And then, after you say that, he’s going to make a ruling on you?  It doesn’t work that way.  Plus, we had a business dispute.  Plus, his relationship with Comey was extraordinary., Now, one other thing I’ll say: Why didn’t he investigate Strzok, and Page, and McCabe, and Comey and all the lies, and Brennan and the lies, and Clapper and the lies to Congress, and all of the things that happened to start this investigation?  Why didn’t Comey come clean?  Why didn’t Comey come clean and say the things that he knows are fact?  Why didn’t Mueller investigate Comey, his best friend or his very good friend?  And there are so many other things., Here’s a question.  This is a study of Russia.  Why didn’t they invest the insurance policy?  In other words, should Hillary Clinton lose, we’ve got an insurance policy.  Guess what?  What we’re in right now is the insurance policy., Q    Do you think he behaved dishonorably?, THE PRESIDENT:  I think he is a total conflicted person.  I think Mueller is a true Never Trumper.  He’s somebody that dislikes Donald Trump.  He’s somebody that didn’t get a job that he requested that he wanted very badly, and then he was appointed.  And despite that — and despite $40 million, 18 Trump haters, including people that worked for Hillary Clinton and some of the worst human beings on Earth — they got nothing.  It’s pretty amazing., Q    Do you believe that Russia helped you get elected?, THE PRESIDENT:  No, Russia did not help me get elected., Q    That’s what it said (inaudible)., THE PRESIDENT:  You know who got me elected?  You know who got me elected?  I got me elected.  Russia didn’t help me at all.  Russia, if anything, I think, helped the other side.  What you ought to ask is this: Do you think the media helped Hillary Clinton get elected?  She didn’t make it, but you take a look at collusion between Hillary Clinton and the media.  You take a look at collusion between Hillary Clinton and Russia.  She had more to do, in the campaign, with Russia than I did.  I had nothing to do., And, by the way, that’s one other thing.  If you look, this was all about Russia, Russia, Russia.  They don’t talk about Russia anymore because it turned out to be a hoax.  It was all a hoax.  And then they say, “Gee, he fought back.  Isn’t that terrible?  He fought back.”  Of course, I fight back.  Because it was a false accusation — a totally false accusation.  And it’s a disgrace.  And it’s a very — it’s a very sad period for this country., And I think, in the end, I will consider what’s happening now to be one of my greatest achievements: exposing this corruption., Q    Do you think they’re going to impeach you?, THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t see how they can.  Because they’re possibly allowed, although I can’t imagine the courts allowing it.  I’ve never gone into it.  I never thought that would even be possible to be using that word.  To me, it’s a dirty word — the word “impeach.”  It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word.  And it had nothing to do with me., So I don’t think so, because there was no crime.  You know, it’s “high crimes and…” not “with” or “or.”  It’s “high crimes and misdemeanors.”  There was no high crime and there was no misdemeanor.  So how do you impeach based on that?, And it came out that there was nothing to do with Russia.  The whole thing is a scam.  It’s one of — it’s a giant presidential harassment.  And, honestly, I hope it goes down as one of my greatest achievements because I’ve exposed corruption — I’ve exposed corruption like nobody knew existed., Q    China says it’s going to restrict (inaudible) and rare earth elements if your trade strategy (inaudible)., THE PRESIDENT:  I think we’re doing very well with China., Come here, I want to shake your hand.  Come here.  You’ve treated me fairly.  Thank you.  Thank you., Q    Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Wait.  I want to answer a real reporter’s question.  We’re going to answer a real reporter’s question, okay?, China would love to make a deal with us.  We had a deal, and they broke the deal.  I think, if they had to do again, they wouldn’t have done what they did.  We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs.  China is subsidizing products.  So the United States taxpayer is paying for very little of it.  And if you look at inflation and if you look at pricing, it’s gone up very little., The tariffs are having a devastating effect on China.  People are fleeing the country with their companies.  These companies are leaving for Vietnam, other parts of Asia, and they’re even coming to the United States because then there’s no tariff., I think we’re doing very well with China.  We’ll see what happens.  But I can tell you China very much wants to make a deal because the companies are leaving China to avoid the tariff.  China is becoming a very weakened nation, just as Iran has become a very weakened nation.  And Iran wants to make a deal also., Q    Will you see Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage in the UK?, THE PRESIDENT:  Say it?, Q    Will you see Boris or Mr. Farage?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I may.  Nigel Farage is a friend of mine.  Boris is a friend of mine.  They’re two very good guys.  Very interesting people.  Nigel has had a big victory; he’s picked up 32 percent of the vote, starting from nothing.  And I think they’re big powers over there.  I think they’ve done a good job., Q    Would you support either of them?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I like them.  I mean, they’re friends of mine, but I haven’t thought about supporting them.  Maybe it’s not my business to support people.  But I have a lot of respect for both of those men., Q    On the USS McCain, do you think it’s fair to the sailors of the John McCain that they were banned from hearing you speak simply because they (inaudible)?, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I don’t know what happened.  I wasn’t involved.  I would not have done that.  I was very angry with John McCain because he killed healthcare.  I was not a big fan of John McCain in any way, shape, or form.  I think John McCain had a lot to getting President Bush — a lot to do with it — to go into the Middle East, which was a catastrophe., To me, John McCain — I wasn’t a fan.  But I would never do a thing like that.  Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn’t like him, okay?  And they were well meaning, I will say.  I didn’t know anything about it.  I would never have done that., Q    Do you owe the sailors of the McCain an apology?, \\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, not at all.  I heard sailors all went on.  We had a tremendous group of sailors from various ships.  It was a beautiful day.  But the McCain thing, I knew nothing about., Q    What are you doing to (inaudible) foreign adversaries from interfering in 2020?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think I’ve been much tougher on elections than President Obama.  President Obama was told, in 2016, just before the election in September, that Russia may try and interfere with the election.  He did nothing.  And the reason he did nothing is he thought Hillary was going to win., \\nWe are doing a lot, and we’re trying to do paper ballots, as a back-up system, as much as possible.  Because going to good, old-fashioned paper, in this modern age, is the best way to do it., Q    (Inaudible) talks with President Putin?  What does the U.S. gain from that?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we want to have a relationship with Russia and China and everybody.  And I’ve said that for a long time.  Getting along with Russia, getting along with China is a good thing if we can do it on fair terms or our terms., Q    (Inaudible) with Venezuela?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Venezuela — we’re just on watch.  We’ll see what happens.  I’d love to see them work out their problems.  I understand there are a lot of talks going on.  But I’m all for the people of Venezuela.  You know that probably better than anyone., Steve, go ahead., Q    In Israel, Netanyahu has been failing to form a coalition.  Are you worried about that?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s too bad what happened in Israel.  It looked like a total win for Netanyahu, who’s a great guy.  He’s a great guy.  And now they’re back in the debate stage and they’re back in the election stage.  That is too bad, because they don’t need this.  I mean, they’ve got enough turmoil over there.  It’s a tough place.  I feel very badly about that., It looks like they’re talking, but more likely they’ll have to go back into election mode.  That’s too bad., Q    The Mueller report said Russia was trying to help you and hurt Hillary Clinton.  Was Mueller wrong about that?, THE PRESIDENT:  I believe that Russia would rather have Hillary Clinton as President of the United States than Donald Trump.  The reason is: Nobody has been tougher on Russia than me.  Whether it’s our energy policy, which was not hers; whether it’s the pipelines, as you know, in Europe, going all over the place that I’ve been bitterly complaining about; whether it’s Ukraine; whether it’s a whole host of things — there has nobody ever been more tough or difficult for Russia than Donald Trump., Now, I have to tell you this: I put sanctions on Russia at a level that nobody has seen before.  Nobody even wants to write about it., With all of that, I want to get along with Russia, and I want to get along with China, and I want to get along with Europe.  I want to get along with everybody, if it’s possible.  I even want to get along with Iran, and Iran wants to talk.  And if they want to talk, I’m available.  Thank you., Q    (Inaudible) what you hope to do?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to be staying at Doonbeg, in Ireland because it’s convenient and it’s a great place.  But it’s convenient.  We’ll be meeting with a lot of the Irish officials, and it’ll be an overnight stay.  And I look forward to that., Q    What will you be discussing with the Taoiseach?, THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of the things that you (inaudible)., Q    Mr. President, do you think the White House should apologize for (inaudible) John McCain?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I can’t because I didn’t know anything about it.  I don’t know who did it.  We’ll probably be able to find out who did it.  They thought they were doing me a favor because they know I am not a fan of John McCain.  John McCain killed healthcare for the Republican Party and he killed healthcare for the nation.  I disagree with John McCain on the way he handled the vets, because I said you got get to Choice.  He was never able to get Choice.  I got Choice.  I disagreed with John McCain on the Middle East.  He helped force Bush to make a very bad decision and go into the Middle East., So, I wasn’t a fan of John McCain and I never will be.  But certainly, I couldn’t care less whether or not there’s a boat named after his father., Q    Robert Mueller did not say “no obstruction.”  He said he did not feel he could charge with you a crime because (inaudible)., THE PRESIDENT:  There were no charges.  None.  If you look at — if you look at Bill Clinton, that very nice gentleman who’s been so much on my side, as you know, his special prosecutor — it was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.  So many guiltys.  With me, there was no guilty.  Number one, there was no crime.  And number two, I fought back.  And I’ll tell you —, Q    (Inaudible) said he couldn’t say “no crime.”, THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Well, here was no collusion.  There was no collusion.  Read volume one.  There was no collusion., Q    (Inaudible.)  He said he could not say there was no crime.  He could not clear you., THE PRESIDENT:  That means you’re innocent.  That means you’re innocent., Q    He said he couldn’t say you were innocent., THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me — then he should’ve said “you’re guilty.”, Q    But he said he couldn’t do that because that would be unfair.  (Inaudible.), THE PRESIDENT:  That’s wrong.  That’s wrong.  No.  Because he said it — he said it differently the first time.  So he said, essentially, “You’re innocent.”  I’m innocent of all charges.  And, you know, the thing that nobody brings up: There was no crime.  They’re saying “he’s obstructing something” and there was no crime.  And nobody brings it up., Also, someday, you ought to read a thing called Article 2.  Read Article 2, which gives the President powers that you wouldn’t believe.  But I don’t even have to rely on Article 2.  There was no crime.  There was no obstruction.  There was no collusion.  There was no nothing.  And this is from a group of people that hate me.  If they only found anything, they would’ve had it.  And he knows that better than anybody., Q    He did not say that you were innocent.  He said he did not —, THE PRESIDENT:  There was no crime, there was no charge because he had no information., Q    Do you agree with Louisiana’s ban on abortion at six weeks?  Is that a good law?, THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to have a statement about it.  And I’m also going to have, probably today, a major statement on the border.  This is a big league statement.  But we are going to do something very dramatic on the border, because people are coming into our country — the Democrats will not give us laws.  They will not change laws.  They will not meet.  They will not do anything.  They want to have open borders.  They want to have crime.  They want to have drugs pouring into our country.  They want to have human trafficking.  I’m going to be making a statement probably tomorrow but maybe today., Q    Are you closing the border?, THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m not closing the border.  I’m doing something else., We’re going to be having a major statement on the border sometime later today or tomorrow., Q    What’s the (inaudible) of it?, THE PRESIDENT:  It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border.  And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border.  We have brought something to the light of the people.  They see now it’s a national emergency, and most people agree.  The Democrats agree too, but they won’t give us the legislation you need to fix it., Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them.  They won’t give us the legislation.  Whether it’s chain migration or whether it’s lottery, they won’t give us any.  And the asylum procedures are ridiculous.  No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws., So I will be making a major statement — I would say my biggest statement — on the border, probably today or tomorrow., Thanks., END, 8:27 A.M.

       "310  [U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro, \\nSan Diego, California, 12:23 P.M. PDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Vice Admiral Fagan.  Thank you for those stirring words.  Thank you for your outstanding leadership and your service to the nation.  Would you all join me in thanking Vice Admiral Fagan one more time — (applause) — for her outstanding leadership of the Pacific Fleet of the U.S. Coast Guard?, To Captain James Estramonte, thank you for the hospitality on this momentous occasion of this historic offload after the maiden voyage of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro.  It’s a great honor for me to be with you., I’m also honored to be here with two great leaders in the fight against drug cartels and drug trafficking.  Join me in thanking Director Jim Carroll and Actor — Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon.  These are friends of mine, and they are in the fight against drug trafficking in this country.  (Applause.)  Thank you., But most of all, it’s an honor to be with all of you, to be able to say “welcome home” after three months of deployment, where each one of you, every single day — as evidenced by the contraband that surrounds us on this deck and that will be offloaded here today — that you truly are gallantry in action.  Let’s hear it for the men and women of the United States Coast Guard Cutter Munro.  Job well done!  (Applause.), Before I talk about the work that you’ve done, allow me to bring greetings from a great fan of the Coast Guard — someone who the Admiral and the Captain know has been a champion of the Guard, making sure that you have the resources and the support to do the mission that the American people cherish the Coast Guard to do every day: not only interdicting in drug trafficking, but saving lives on the high seas., So allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.), I came here today on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, and on behalf of the American people, to say thank you.  Thank you for a job well done, and welcome home.  You’ve been keeping watch, and you’ve been protecting American families on this mission., You know, the President just said last week, in his words, “Coasties…secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists…[And] when the red racing stripes of a Coast Guard vessel break the horizon…those in distress know that help is on the way, and our enemies know their time has come.”  Thanks for proving that on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro, on your first mission.  (Applause.), And let me commend you, especially, for your new deployment to the Eastern Pacific corridor.  I’m told that “East Pac” is the route for 80 percent of the cocaine that makes it to America, enslaving Americans through addiction, destroying families and communities, and claiming lives., Even though this is a new area of deployment for this cutter, you’ve already proven yourselves more than up to the task.  Today’s offload totals more than 39,000 pounds of cocaine, 933 pounds of marijuana, and will lead to the prosecution of 55 alleged smugglers.  That is a remarkable record of success., Fourteen operations went into this offload.  One of them was of a self-propelled, semi-submersible vessel, which resulted in the largest Coast Guard removal in four years., The Coast Guard is seizing illegal drugs at a faster rate than ever before.  And you all have been at the tip of the spear, making that happen., Since October 2016, the Coast Guard has actually seized more than 1.2 million pounds of cocaine.  And already this year, the Coast Guard has seized roughly $3.6 billion in illegal drugs and detained more than 400 alleged smugglers., And make no mistake about it, Coasties: Your courageous service is saving American lives.  Give yourselves a round of applause.  (Applause.)  It’s true.  I mean, think about it: A pound of cocaine is enough for thousands of fatal doses.  And you’ve kept thousands of pounds of cocaine out of our communities, on this mission., Your work is more important to our nation than ever before.  And as we heard moments ago, in the past decade, cocaine has claimed the lives of some 70,000 Americans — sons and daughters, moms and dads, neighbors and friends.  And while we’ve been reeling from the opioid crisis across this country, cocaine deaths doubled nationwide from 2013 to 2016., And transnational criminal organizations are relentless in their efforts to bring cocaine across our borders.  Just last week, CBP made the largest cocaine seizure in the history of Customs and Border Protection.  They seized a ship that was found to have more than a billion dollars’ worth of cocaine on it — on just one ship., And make no mistake about it: These two issues are linked.  The proceeds of cocaine sales are often used to fund opioid trafficking, as well., And so I’m here today, on behalf of the President of the United States and all of the American people to pay a debt of gratitude and respect to each and every one of you and your families who supported you during this deployment.  Because this Cutter is full of patriots.  You’ve already served this nation with distinction., You know, I was on my way here and I read up on the namesake of this ship — the only Coast Guardsman ever to receive Medal of Honor., Munro is a legend not only in the Coast Guard, in our armed forces, but also in the Marine Corps.  And it was just a week ago, Admiral, that I heard the story for the first time — that his life was slipping away from mortal injuries that he suffered when that Coast Guardsman made it possible for Marines to exit the beach in 1943.  His last words were, “Did they get off?”, This is a proud ship with a proud tradition.  And the men and women standing before me today in this deployment have done the name Munro and U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro’s namesake proud.  Well done.  (Applause.), And I know you’re men and women from every walk of life.  You volunteered to be in the Coast Guard.  You’re serving with great distinction — like a guy who has led hull and deck preservation for this cutter, I heard about.  At the same time, he’s also led the deck’s division small boat operations.  I’m told he led pursuits of smugglers up to 40 knots in speed, including one pursuit last month that led to the seizure of 4,000 pounds of contraband., And I’d mention him today even if his birthday wasn’t tomorrow.  Would you all join me in recognizing and thank Petty Officer Derrick Jones?  Where are you?  Job well done, Derrick.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Great job.  And happy birthday., Another Petty Officer who has served the Coast Guard for 16 years I’m told served on two other national security cutters.  And before they came to the Munro, he participated in operations that seized more than 34,000 pounds of contraband, Admiral.  I’m told that he is a true leader and also a proud son of California.  So let’s hear it for Petty Officer John D’Arcy.  Well done, John.  Thanks for a great career of service.  (Applause.)  We’re grateful for you., The American people are grateful not just to these two, but each and every one of you.  It’s why I’m here.  It’s why you stood out here in the sun so long today — just so you’d hear it.  Hear it one more time.  And I want to promise you: You not only have the gratitude of the President and the American people, but I promise you, in President Donald Trump, you have a Commander-in-Chief who will always have your back., And this President has made a priority from the first day of our administration to make sure the men and women of our armed forces have the resources and the support that you need — the best training and the best equipment in the history of warfare., You know, I’m proud to say that in our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in more than 10 years.  And you deserved every single penny., He also signed into law more than $12 billion for the Coast Guard to rebuild aging ships and strengthen your vital assets., As all of you know, when your vessels are operating beyond their planned service lives, it — it can jeopardize the mission, and more importantly, it can jeopardize your safety.  And we’re not going to have it., And the truth is, recently, the mighty Cutter Bear — which I was on, Admiral, just a few months ago — was delayed in departing for a counter-narcotics patrol because of engineering problems.  But we’re setting all that right., Our Coast Guard deserves better.  That’s why we are committed to fully funding our Coast Guard and replacing old ships with new ones, just like the U.S. Cutter Munro.  Get ready.  More help is on the way.  (Applause.), This year we’re celebrating, also, 20 years of HITRON, which has been proven so instrumental in today’s offload and in so many other counterdrug efforts.  This administration understands how effective HITRON is for you.  And the President’s budget for next year, I’m proud to report, has proposed increasing HITRON deployment days by 25 percent., We’ve made incredible progress in strengthening our military and giving all of you the resources to make the fight against the drug crisis over the last two and a half years., But as you know, not all of the battle that we fight is on the seas.  You know, as my fellow Americans, that we have a crisis at our southern border.  But what you all understand, I’m certain — and I want to you know we understand: Every day that our southern border remains unsecured gives criminal syndicates and drug traffickers more opportunity to peddle their poison and spread the violence that’s cut short too many American lives.  That’s why we’re in this fight to end the crisis at our southern border., And the truth is the men and women of the Coast Guard and the DEA know firsthand the transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America — and the drug cartels that fuel their deadly trades — represent one of the greatest national security and public health threats to the American people., These criminal organizations in Central America are also helping to fuel the crisis at our southern border by literally driving thousands of vulnerable families out of their homes to take the long and dangerous journey north., But you in the Coast Guard are taking the fight to those criminal traffickers and attacking our border crisis at its root., For four years in a row, the DEA has told us that Mexican drug cartels “remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.”  And those are tough words., The drugs that they bring across our border cost us lives and billions of dollars in healthcare expenses that result in crime in our streets and tear apart our communities., Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age.  In 2016, across America, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day.  Don’t doubt for a second, as you embark on your next deployment, that the work you’re doing is more important now than ever before.  And what you seize and put on these decks to be offloaded has prevented from tearing apart communities and lives across America., The truth is the illicit drug trade also fuels gang violence.  It provides funding for other crimes, like extortion and human trafficking., And the challenges and threats that you face every day underscore why we remain so determined not just to give the Coast Guard the resources you need to accomplish your mission, but this President and this administration is determined and will not rest until we secure our southern border and we end the crisis at our southern border once and for all., As the President said, it’s a “moral issue,” and we have a moral duty not just to secure our border but “to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.”, We’ve got work to do.  But I promise, my fellow Americans gathered here, we will not rest or relent until we stop the flow of illegal drugs pouring into our country across that southern border., That’s why this President declared a national emergency.  We’ve already begun to build the wall on the southern border., That’s why this President reached a historic agreement with Mexico, securing the most significant commitments from the Mexican government in more than 20 years., And that’s why the President negotiated a bipartisan bill just a few short weeks ago that’s now speeding $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid to support the compassionate work of Customs and Border Protection and Health and Human Services at our border., I’ll be traveling there tomorrow.  I’ll be bringing a delegation of senators.  And we’ll be showing them and the American people, firsthand, that our system is overwhelmed, but the men and women of Customs and Border Protection are providing compassionate care to vulnerable families swept up in this crisis., In the days ahead, I want you to be confident that just as you fight every day to keep our nation safe, this President and this administration will keep fighting for you.  We’re grateful for all you do., The men and women of the Coast Guard are from the rest of us, but you’re the best of us.  You really are.  And on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, allow me to admonish you: In these challenging times, for those who would do harm to our families, take to the Pacific, mind your mission.  On the next deployment, take care of your people, respect the chain of command, never doubt your calling, and never doubt your ability to do your duty.  You wouldn’t be here if you couldn’t., And never doubt that your work is more important than ever before.  Rescuing Americans from the scourge of drug abuse and rescuing those in peril on the seas is an essential calling of the modern United States Coast Guard., So stay on mission and know that, as your work is vital to the security of this nation, be ,  — be always ready., I know the Commander-in-Chief and the American people can count on you just as we have on this last deployment., And never doubt that you have the support of not only this President and his Vice President but of the American people.  You have their admiration.  And when the winds blow and the rains come down, the hurricane gale force strikes, the American people marvel at the Coast Guard.  And I expect when news of today is reported around the country of this incredible offload, they’ll be inspired again by your selflessness, your professionalism, and your patriotism., And never doubt as you sail that you go with their support and ours, and you also go with the prayers of millions who I know will pray always, as they did on this last deployment, for your next.  That as you serve in this great Coast Guard, as you “rise on the wings of the dawn, if you settle on the far side of the sea,” that even there you would know that “His right hand will hold [you] fast.”  And that will be our prayer., So thank you for the honor of addressing you today.  My heartfelt congratulations to the Captain and the outstanding crew of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro on a job well done.  Thank you for your service.  God bless you.  God bless the Coast Guard.  And God continue to bless the United States of America.  Thanks everybody.  (Applause.), END, 12:42 P.M.

       "312  [Otay Mesa Border Wall Site, \\nSan Diego, California, September 18, 2019, \\n3:11 P.M. PDT, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, why don’t you start, Kevin?  And this has been a very exciting project, as you know.  It’s — for many years, people have wanted the proper wall and we have a wall that — the likes of which, very few places have ever seen., And I want to thank all of the people.  General Semonite from the Army Corps of Engineers — we’re working very closely with them.  I want to thank Kevin and all of your staff —, ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Thank you, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  — because what they’ve done is beyond., And I wanted to show you some of the details of the wall.  You can see — you can see a pretty good view.  This is going to be close to 500 miles by the time we finish.  Those are the areas that are most important., After we’re completed 5- — that should be done pretty close to next year.  Over — it’ll be over 400 miles.  And we think we can get it close to 500 miles by the end of next year, depending on certain terrain conditions.  But we’re doing all of the most important areas.  We have a lot of natural barriers, like mountains and streams and rivers and — some pretty vicious and violent rivers, actually.  But it’s — it’s an amazing project., And I think what I’d like you to do is if you could explain the interior of these pipes.  The wall is 30 feet high.  We also have 18-foot wall.  We have a combination of 30 feet and 18 [feet], depending on the area, depending on the — on the importance., Tijuana is right over here.  There are thousands of people over there that had been trying to get in.  Tremendous cooperation from Mexico.  And the President of Mexico has been fantastic.  All of Mexico has been fantastic.  As you know, right now they have 27,000 soldiers.  So, in addition to the wall, we have the soldiers., Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we’re building it at a breakneck speed.  I wanted them to show you the interior of parts of the wall and what’s inside of each individual slat.  And you’ll see it’s a combination of steel, concrete, and — as one of the folks just said — it really is virtually impenetrable.  Any walls that were put up would get knocked down very quickly, very easily.  This wall is not something that can be really knocked down.  I guess anything can, but this is very tough., And it goes down six feet.  It’s three and four feet wide.  The concrete — you see it right here; it’s exposed.  And I might ask General Semonite to say a few words about it., And I’d like to bring them right up — look at the inner tube — to see what happens.  Because after the wall is up, we pour concrete, and concrete goes into the tube.  And in addition to that, we have rebar.  So if you think you’re going to cut it with a blowtorch, that doesn’t work because you hit concrete.  And then if you think you’re going to go through the concrete, that doesn’t work because we have very powerful rebar inside., So it’s a very powerful, very powerful wall — the likes of which, probably, to this extent, has not been built before., This is an area — because it’s so highly trafficked, this was one of the most dangerous areas.  We have a double wall.  We have a wall on both sides.  One is 18 feet; that’s your border.  And the other one is 30 feet.  And everybody — if they should be able to make that, this is where people are waiting for them.  It’s a very — a very powerful situation., So, General, maybe you could take over for a couple of minutes, and then I’ll take it back., GENERAL SEMONITE:  So, Mr. President, I want to build on your comments.  This is a system.  It is both the two walls, but it also is the road networks, down through the middle and the back, so that the Customs and Border can go ahead and continue to be able to move around it.  Also, a lighting system., And if you think about this, I mean, it really is kind of a defense in depth.  When you think about these panels going up — right now, we’re putting in about 270 panels a day that are going in the ground.  We’ve got over 44,000 panels that are already built.  And you think about the depth of how we’re doing it., Without getting into a lot of details: 66 miles today are already completed.  There’s 251 miles that are under contract, going in the ground right now at 17 other sites.  There’s 163 miles that are actually on contracts that are going to be (inaudible) in the next 90 days.  And the remainder of the miles the President talked about is mainly private land that takes a little bit longer to get., One of the things I want to just remind you about: That when you have a football field — kind of a flat area like this — it’s a little bit easier to build a wall.  But if you just turn around and look at the mountain behind you, one of the projects that’s going to go up in the next year continues this barrier right up over the rest of that mountain.  So it goes back to being able to — we’ve got to have this linear capability to be able to continue to provide that level of defense., We will talk — this is what the bollards look like.  Thirty feet high on the backside.  And you’ll see, on the inside, there was a time —, THE PRESIDENT:  Come on over here, if you want.  You can bring the cameras.  It’s sort of interesting., GENERAL SEMONITE:  — where people were worried that maybe you could negotiate — you could negotiate through the bollard., So what the bollard is now, again, is that there are two pieces of rebar — 12 feet long — that are inside the bollard.  And then, when we put it up, we put concrete in.  I won’t tell you the depth of the concrete, but it is a pretty substantial obstacle to be able to go through., And I would defer to you, Commissioner, for anything else you want to add., ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Yeah.  Thanks, General.  So a very important part of this — and that’s why the President was talking about the (inaudible).  Right here, what we — part of what the wall gets is, is it gets the men and women of CBP, specifically Border Patrol, operational capacity to get to the area where people are trying to illegally cross., Before — the old landing style — they could cut through that in seconds.  Sometimes, they could come in a vehicle and just knock it over, and literally, within seconds, they were in the United States illegally.  This makes it almost impenetrable., Right now, they’ve had four attempts to cut through this.  All four times it’s failed.  Border Patrol has been able to respond and interdict those individuals., This, right here — this design — it’s a game changer., THE PRESIDENT:  And the reason we pour the concrete afterwards is because it’s too heavy to lift when the concrete is poured in.  So we put it up and we pour the concrete.  A lot of people don’t see that.  But we pour the concrete afterwards., So you have the rebar, you have the steel, and then you have concrete.  And it’s hardened concrete.  Very powerful concrete.  What is that — 4,000 pounds or 5,000-pound concrete?, GENERAL SEMONITE:  That would be 5,000, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s a very strong — that’s a very powerful concrete.  And a lot of technological advances have been made with concrete.  It sounds pretty simple, but it’s not.  It’s a very powerful concrete., So you have the rebar, you have the outer crust, and you have the inside is concrete.  And it’s pretty amazing.  And, again, the concrete is poured after it’s up.  They pour it through funnels and cover much of the territory of the bollard., GENERAL SEMONITE:  Mr. President, also, this is a great view to look at the anti-climb.  I defer to the Commissioner to explain what that panel does., ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Hey, you know what?  I’d actually turn this over right now to our chief patrol agent right now, Agent Harrison.  He’s really going to be able to give you, from an agent’s perspective, exactly the magnitude of what this wall — the operational capacity — gives the Border Patrol agents., AGENT HARRISON:  Thank you, Commissioner and Mr. President.  So, so you know, sir, this is the wall that the agents asked for.  And they wanted me to tell you personally that they appreciate this — and not only this here, but the extension that — it’s bringing the secondary out, further out.  They really appreciate it.  It makes them safer —, THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  You’ve been great.  You guys have been great., AGENT HARRISON:  — it makes the community safer, and it allows us to make that apprehension here in the border zone, as opposed to getting in vehicles and getting in pursuits on the highway.  We want to make that apprehension here., THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, just in terms of the quality, I came with the Border Patrol — we worked with them very closely.  I said, “Fellas, how about doing a less expensive version?”  They said, “Well, this is the version that works” — including the poured concrete in the steel, with the rebar and everything else.  That’s the Rolls Royce version., Then I said, “Well, fellas, how about doing one wall instead of two?”  In a lot of areas, we have two — where you have tremendous amounts of people on the other side trying to break through.  We know exactly where those areas are — Tijuana being over here, as I said.  And they said, “Well, sir, two works much better in these areas.”  A lot more expensive.  So, we have the one side, on the border — 18 [feet].  And then we have over here, 30 feet., And I think one of the things you were asking, Mark, and wanted somebody to explain is the protection on top — how that stops.  It’s an anti-climb device, if you look at the steel on top.  It’s also structural, but actually it was there, more importantly, for anti-climb., Do you want to explain that?  The panels up top., AGENT HARRISON:  So it’s one thing to figure out how to navigate the vertical posts, but the transition at the top makes the climb orders of magnitude more difficult.  It requires different equipment, different tools, different skills.  And so it’s the change, as we get to the top, that adds to the protection of that fence, sir., ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  And, again, anything that we can do to give the Border Patrol agent even a few more seconds, a few more minutes to respond — that’s a game changer., And, sir, if you don’t mind, I think this is important to talk about.  The chief patrol agent just mentioned — is that there’s a false narrative out there that this wall is the President’s vanity wall.  I’m here to tell you right now that’s false.  This President, this administration — what they did is exactly what the President just explained.  He reached out to the experts — to the Border Patrol agents that are on the frontlines every single day, risking their lives protecting this country, enforcing the laws that Congress enacted.  He reached out to those agents, to those line agents, and asked, “What do you need to do your job more effectively to secure and safeguard this country?”  And those Border Patrol agents said, “We need this.”, \\nSo, this President — thank you.  You listened to the agents and you gave them exactly what they asked for., THE PRESIDENT:  This is your maximum that you can do.  And one thing we haven’t mentioned is technology.  They’re wired so that we will know if somebody is trying to break through.  And you may want to discuss that a little bit, General., GENERAL SEMONITE:  Sir, there could be some merit in not discussing that., THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  (Laughter.)  I like that.  That was a great answer.  I’ll just tell you they’re wired, okay?  They’re wired.  They’re, technologically, very advanced.  All set up for cameras any place we want.  We have all of the — everything we need.  But it’s all set up for cameras, for anything.  And you’ve been hearing “drone technology” — they’re all wired out for drone technology.  Anything you want, we have., And, frankly, this is the right time to do it.  Because to do it later, after it’s built is very expensive.  This way, it’s mostly just adding wire.  So we’re all set up to adapt., And that’s the story.  We have certain areas like this, where you have double walls.  If you look behind, you can see how it goes up the hill.  And that goes many miles in that direction.  And we’re starting now many miles in this direction., We also have — it all fits together like a puzzle.  How many sites would you say, over the next period of time, will have been started construction?, GENERAL SEMONITE:  Sir, probably about 35 sites.  At any one given point, all working — and some of the contractors, actually — if they’re building five miles, they might having one on one end, one on the other, and one in the middle, so they get the maximum amount of people building at the same time., THE PRESIDENT:  So we have different bids and different contractors.  This is one contractor — an excellent contractor, by the way.  They’re doing a really good job.  But we have many contractors bidding on many different parts in different states — in Arizona; New Mexico, where I just left.  We have great contractors bidding, and we’re starting walls in New Mexico.  The Arizona wall are moving along really well.  They’re really moving along rapidly, and they need them desperately., And part of the beauty — sometimes you’ll see the tunneling, where they go under the wall.  Here, this goes down — the concrete goes down very deep.  It’s very hard to tunnel.  You can’t tunnel.  It’s actually dangerous.  But, at a certain point, you hit rock, so you can’t tunnel.  So we have it covered underground.  We have it covered over ground., \\nAnd this is — as I said, this is the finest you can do.  I said, “Let’s do it differently.  We don’t have to go 30 feet.”  They said, “Sir, if you don’t do 30 feet, it won’t be the same, because of the climb.”, We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers.  We got climbers.  We had 20 mountain climbers.  That’s all they do; they love to climb mountains.  They can have it.  Me, I don’t want to climb mountains.  But they’re very good.  And some of them were champions.  And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb., And we’ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back — a lot of drugs.  I mean, they’re unbelievable climbers.  This wall can’t be climbed.  This is very, very hard., And what the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it’s also very hard to get by panel.  Plus, it’s designed to absorb heat, so it’s extremely hot.  The wall is — you won’t be able to touch it.  You can — you can fry an egg on that wall.  It’s very, very hot., So if they’re going to climb it, they’re going to have bring hoses and waters — water.  And we don’t’ know where they’re going to hook it up, because there’s not a lot of water out here.  So it’s a very, very hard thing to climb., We were thinking about an all-concrete wall — this is a much more expensive version — but they want to be able to have a vision in through — looking through Mexico, looking in both directions.  They have to be able to because otherwise you have a block; you can’t see what’s going on on the other side.  They can build — literally, they could have a group of some pretty tough people out there.  And we don’t want to do that., You may want to explain that.  Why would you want — you need this vision.  It was so important.  Because, frankly, an all-concrete wall would have been a much less expensive wall to build.  But from the standpoint of Border Patrol, they were very much opposed to it., Go ahead., AGENT HARRISON:  So, sir, as you mentioned, it — our agents patrol along these walls., THE PRESIDENT:  Right., AGENT HARRISON:  And as they get closer to that, being able to see the threat through the wall prior to a rock coming over the fence or something else coming over the fence at them is just — it’s an officer-safety thing, sir.  And we appreciate it., THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Yeah.  It worked out.  And I understood., It’s sort of interesting; I always envisioned maybe it’s a solid concrete wall.  And that would have been easy to do.  But every time I had a meeting with Border Patrol, with ICE, with the General, with the — everybody involved — with Kevin, with Mark, they said, “Sir, we have to be able to see through.  If you don’t see through, this thing is not going to work.  It’s not going to be a good situation.”, They even talk about things where somebody would be talking on one side of the wall and they would throw up bags of drugs that weigh 100 pounds.  They would catapult it up and over the wall.  And it was — I mean, we’ve had instances where people got hit on the other side because you don’t see who’s over there.  So having the wall, though it’s more expensive, but it’s the right thing to do., And people that have seen it — other countries are now coming, as you know, and they’re studying the wall, because other people are thinking about something.  The only thing is, I’m not sure that they can afford a wall like this.  This is —, Q    Which countries?, THE PRESIDENT:  This is really — I will tell you at a certain point if I get their approval.  We’ve had three of them already.  They’re coming and they’re studying the wall.  But I’ll let you know.  If I can get their approval, I’ll give that., Who asked that?  Jeff?, Q    That was me., THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll give you that information if I can.  I want to ask their approval first, okay?, So that’s pretty much it.  Again, the President of Mexico has been great.  The soldiers who are right outside — we have a lot of soldiers right now — they’ve been great.  Twenty-seven thousand, I think, is the number, as of today., And this will be something very special.  I want to thank Mark.  And I want to thank Kevin.  And I want to thank you.  Really fantastic job they’ve done.  The whole — the whole group.  Border Patrol has been incredible.  And the knowledge that you’ve imparted — who would think this is what we had to do?  But that’s it., When you look down here, you’ll see on a more flat area — this is fairly flat — you’ll see what the wall looks like, and it’s pretty impressive., If the cameras can look down here — and these are the real people.  These are the workers that put up the wall, by the way.  All of these guys, they don’t do as much of that.  (Laughter.)  But these guys do a great job, but we appreciate it, fellas.  These are the ones that are here., Each one of these is considered a panel.  When they said — how many panels are you going to put up?, GENERAL SEMONITE:  Over 44,000 are in right now, sir., THE PRESIDENT:  Forty-four thousand are already in.  Each one of these — if you look they’re — they’re together.  So each one of these, I think, they have — so they would have — yeah — like eight?  Eight., ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Yes sir., THE PRESIDENT:  Eight bollards., ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Right., THE PRESIDENT:  And each one of them — so I guess it’s mostly an eight bollard.  We also have some very sophisticated openings when you have to get the Border Patrol through or various people through to the other side.  We have some really beautiful openings that work, I hear, really well.  I hear we finally figured that one out, right?, That’s — that was not an easy thing to figure out because of the weight.  The weight is — it’s tremendously heavy., But if you look down here, you’ll see what the wall looks like.  And the beautiful thing is that people are seeing that we’re not going to do — in another week, I understand — no more catch and release.  We’re not allowing people into the country at all anymore.  Nobody is coming in unless they’re coming in legally.  They’re coming in through a process., We have it covered between 27,000 Mexican soldiers.  And, really, now the wall is starting to kick in very big.  San Diego was just — they were just thanking me for the wall we built in San Diego.  It’s like — they said it’s a difference of day and night.  They actually said, “It’s 100 percent.”, The only thing is we have to now expand it out.  The only way they get through to walk many, many miles in the opposite direction — one way or the other — and go around it.  But going over it is impossible — is virtually impossible.  But they were very, very happy with what we’ve done., So the days — and I tell you this very strongly: No more people can come in.  We wanted Congress to help us.  It would have made life very easy.  And we still want them to get rid of loopholes, but we’ve done it a different way.  We’ve done it with the help of Mexico.  We’ve done it with the help of Border Patrol.  And we’ve done it with the help of Kevin and all of your great people, and Mark.  We’ve done it a different way., We still want them to do it because it would be a little bit easier, but Congress wouldn’t do it.  When I say “Congress” — the Democrats just wouldn’t do it.  So now we have a world-class security system at the border, including the highest technology.  I would think that there’s no place like this anywhere.  There’s no place has anything like this or even close to it., Now, other places have guards and, unfortunately, they have machine guns and they have electrified fences.  You touch them and you get electrocuted.  We don’t do that.  We don’t do that.  But this is something that is equally difficult to get across., Okay?, Q    Can you explain what was here before?  Was there fencing here?  Was there anything here?, THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  We had a very low fencing here.  In fact, you were here before, I think.  We had a very low fencing.  It was a — like a sheet metal.  And people would knock it over, like just routinely.  And we ripped it out., We have a lot of areas where we had that and even less than that, and then we have areas where we had nothing.  We had some areas where we just had a pipe along the ground and that, sort of, stopped cars or trucks, but they’d knock that out pretty quickly., ...]

       "313  [East Room, 12:55 P.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student. Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed — did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor., And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer has just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, “Never Trump.” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that., I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time — we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that., And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we’ll do some questions — unless you have no questions. That’s always a possibility., I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we’ve done., A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it — let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that’s good. Now it means that’s good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them., I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay too., Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control., I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure, we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not — the distortion. And we’ll talk about it, and you’ll be able to ask me questions about it., But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places — low-pay, low-wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea — we’ll take care of it, folks. We’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess., Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many., We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom — and meetings — Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka., I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis — he’s over there now, working very hard — to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer. Another mess I inherited., And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism. And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now. It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody., I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I’ve had great support from the Senate. I’ve had great support from Congress generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it, I talked about it at every stop. Depleted — it’s depleted. It won’t be depleted for long., And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength., At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders. They’re so surprised — “oh, you’re having strong borders.” Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else., One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lie to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians., I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before. So that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan., In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason. But a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there., I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos! Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval., So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me., Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals — bilateral. We’re going to have one-on-one deals., We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit — it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process — they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense — and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection. It’s not going to take years. But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries., We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they’re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing., We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer., We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we’re going to have a wall that works. We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke., We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are — release. We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many., We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters safe — and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are. I can tell you that., Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I’ve heard 80 percent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that and we are going further., We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part., We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new “Buy American” measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen. We want them to use American steel. And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea. We put it in., To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It’s a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare — I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing. So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. We’re bringing our jobs back to this country big league. It’s already happening, but big league., I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson — he’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people., Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade — not free — fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do., Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know — you were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here., Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we’re naming., Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades and decades and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen., And one more thing. I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes., This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week., So we’re just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions., Mara. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference., Q Did you fire Mike Flynn?, THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who — there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given., He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — they know nothing about it. They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news., The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara — and I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call. All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place., The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed., Yes, go ahead., Q Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?, THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to be — and he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He’s doing the job., You know, he was just doing his job. The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision., But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me., Yes., Q President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was — it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story — I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part — I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him, ever. And he thought it was a joke., The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia — but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s, by the way — who’s, by the way, a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody. But everybody — people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories., So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders — almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that’s the extent., Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there — because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA. James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one. And he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in., And just while you’re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday. And it talked about — you saw it, front page. So, Director of National Intelligence just put out — acting — a statement: “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” — this was just given to us — “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.”, So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal — top — and they just wrote the story is not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest — because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me — front page. Big massive story. And it was nasty., And then they called. They said, “We never said that. We like Mr. Trump.” They called up my office — we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you — totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And, frankly, I then went on to other things., Go ahead., Q Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT: You okay?, Q I am. Just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008., THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m talking about Republican. Yes., Q President Obama, 332. George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told — I was given that information. I don’t know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin., Q I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you’re providing information that’s fake?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don’t know. I was given that information. I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?, Q You’re the President., THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you. That’s a good answer. Yes., Q Mr. President, thank you so much. Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn — there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?, And further than that, sir, you’ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks., THE PRESIDENT: We are., Q Can we ask what you’re doing to do? And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position. So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own., As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came — Don McGahn, White House Counsel — and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong. He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don’t see — to me, he was doing the job., The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job., So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man., Yes, Jon., Q On the leaks, sir —, THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon., Q Sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today —, THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies. I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act., You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen. But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine. I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important. But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?, So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I’m dealing with Mexico. I’m dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We’ve got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty., Yes, Jon., Q Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said — you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake., So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters. It’s very important to me, and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true. And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that. But I’m not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no. It’s okay, Jim. It’s okay, Jim. You’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly., But I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better., People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter, is that one right? Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress., But honestly, the public would appreciate it. I’d appreciate it. Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for., And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that’s okay. That’s fine., But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it., Yeah, go ahead, Jim., Q The first part of my question on contacts. Do you definitively say that nobody —, ...]  \n",
       "314  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 2:19 P.M. EDT, MS. SANDERS:  Slow news day?  Quiet crowd?  Good afternoon.  To mark the last day of Made in America Week, this afternoon the President will welcome several living survivors of the attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor and their families., Other events this week have focused mainly on the products and goods bearing that highly esteemed Made in America label., But truly the most prized thing to have come out of our country have been the brave men and women who have risked their lives protecting the freedom of Americans and our allies around the globe., And just a few minutes ago at two o’clock, the President signed an executive order that will ensure the men and women of the greatest military in the world have the ships, aircraft, vehicles, and other supplies they will need to keep us safe in the years ahead., This order commissions the first-ever, whole-government assessment of America’s defense industrial base, marking the first time since President Eisenhower that an American President is investing personal attention into the health of the United States defense industrial base., President Trump is committed to maintaining the secure supply chains and robust workforce that will support our nation’s heroes for decades to come., Next week, we’ll be highlighting American heroes like the World War Two veterans, the first responders who keep our communities safe every day, and the boys and girls who will grow up to be the next generation of American leaders., While I’m on the topic of the men and women who protect us, I also wanted to note that the President commended the House yesterday for voting to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security for the first time., The Homeland Security Authorization Act also authorizes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the first time.  Secretary Kelly has already made tremendous progress in fulfilling the President’s promise to end illegal immigration and fully enforce the laws of the United States, and this bill reflects the President’s strong commitment to ensuring that progress continues., Also on the Hill, of course, Senate Republicans this week continued to work toward our shared goal of saving the American people from the disaster of Obamacare., Earlier this afternoon, Vice President Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price hosted representatives from several grassroots organizations calling on the Senate to take action on healthcare legislation., As the President has said, inaction is simply not an option.  These groups want lawmakers to know that their members want them to follow through on their promise to the American people., Finally I’d like to read a statement from the President on the resignation of Press Secretary Sean Spicer:, “I am grateful for Sean’s work on behalf of my administration and the American people.  I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities:  Just look at his great television ratings.”, Sean will continue to serve the administration through August., And the President has also appointed Anthony Scaramucci as Communications Director and I have statement on Anthony’s appointment as well:, “Anthony is a person I have great respect for, and he will be an important addition to this administration.  He has been a great supporter and will now help implement key aspects of our agenda while leading the communications team.  We have accomplished so much, and we are being given credit for so little.  The good news is the people get it, even if the media doesn’t.”, And I’d like to bring Anthony up to say a few words and take a few questions.  As always I’ll be back after that to answer any follow-up questions., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Thank you, Sarah.  Thank you very much., So I’m going to be very brief.  I’m going to make my remarks informal and then I’ll take questions from everybody., First off, I’d like to announce formally that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to the press —, Q    We can’t hear., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Oh, you can’t hear me?  I’m sorry.  Better?  Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to be the press secretary, and so you can congratulate her after the — you still can’t hear me?  No sound?  Better?  Better now?, I’m going to start over.  (Laughter.)  You guys heard me in the front, though, right?  What did I say, John?  Sarah is going to be the press secretary right?, Q    Press secretary.  Congratulations., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Okay, so congratulations to you, Sarah.  (Applause.), And so I want to make a couple of statements.  The first thing I want to say is I want to thank personally Sean Spicer not only behalf of myself, the President, the administration, but Sean is a true American patriot.  He’s a military serviceman.  He’s got a great family, and he’s done an amazing job., This is obviously a difficult situation to be in, and I applaud his efforts here, and I love the guy, and I wish him well, and I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money., As it relates to me in this position, I’m going to spend a couple of weeks getting to know the people here, and I’m going to be as coordinated as I can with the people inside the West Wing., There’s been some speculation in the press about me and Reince so I just want to talk about that very quickly.  Reince and I have been personal friends for six years.  We are a little bit like brothers where we rough each other up once in a while, which is totally normal for brothers.  There’s a lot of people in here who have brothers, and so you get that.  But he’s a dear friend.  He brought me into the political system.  He brought me into the Republican National Committee network.  He introduced me to Governor Walker.  We’ve spent many times together socially.  A lot of people are not aware about this, but after the Romney campaign, I invited Reince into SkyBridge.  I think it reflects poorly on Reince that he didn’t take my offer to come in and be our chief operating officer, but I say that in jest obviously., And so what I want you guys to know is that he was my first call this morning.  I met with him before we sat in the Oval Office, and we are committed as true professionals to the team and the process of getting the administration’s message out.  I think that is going to be one of the big goals for us., I said during the transition, and I’ll say it up here, I think there has been at times a disconnect between the way we see the President and how much we love the President, and the way some of you perhaps see the President.  I certainly see the American people probably see the President the way I do, but we want to get that message out there.  And to use a Wall Street expression, there might be an arbitrage spread between how well we are doing and how well some of you guys think we’re doing, and we’re going to work hard to close that spread., And so I’m done.  I’ll take your questions.  Yes.  I’ll —, Q    Yes, two questions for you, Anthony —, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  — as many people as I can until she hooks me., Q    Sure.  Two questions for you.  Number one, what we have seen from this administration so far is the President being his own messenger very frequently, and that has caused, as you know, some struggles for the communications staff.  How do you expect to get this White House back on track?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I’m going to take a slight issue with the question because I actually think the White House is on track, and we’re actually I think doing a really good job., Q    From a messaging perspective?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I actually do think from a messaging perspective because we have a whole list of things.  And I didn’t want to come out here with our list of accomplishments and start a whole advertisement infomercial right now.  I really just wanted to talk about personnel movement and how we’re thinking about things.  But I think we’re doing an amazing job., The President himself is always going to be the President.  I was in the Oval Office with him earlier today, and we were talking about letting him be himself, letting him express his full identity.  I think he’s got some of the best political instincts in the world and perhaps in history.  When you think about it he started his political ascent two years and two months ago, and he’s done a phenomenal job for the American people., And the people I grew up with, they so identify with the President, and they love him.  And so we’re going to get that message out., \\nQ    And my second question to you —, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  I’m going to get to everybody.  Don’t worry., Q    If you can speak a little bit about how you plan to — obviously, you’re a business guy; you’re a Wall Street guy — how you plan to handle any potential conflicts of interest and walk us through how this offer was made to you, what the President said when you were here, what the conversations were like?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I don’t think it’s fair to the President for me to go into the exact conversation because I want to keep those conversations between me and him private.  But we talked a little bit about the White House.  We talked a little bit about our personal relationship.  And then when he extended the offer to me, I said, I would do it because I want to serve the President., One of the things — I have a lot of family members that served in the American military.  Unfortunately, my generation — I’m born in 1964, I did not serve.  I filled out the Selective Service.  It’s one of the regrets for my life, so this is an opportunity for me to serve the country., I love the President.  I obviously love the country.  Look at my life experience here in the country, and so it’s an honor to be here.  It’s an honor to stand here actually., Q    And on the conflicts?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  In terms of my personal business conflicts?, Q    Correct, yes., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, so I have worked with the Office of Government Ethics to take care of all of my business conflicts.  My start date is going to be in a couple of weeks so that it’s 100 percent totally cleansed and clean.  And I don’t see an issue with it.  The Office of Government Ethics doesn’t see an issue with it, nor does the White House Counsel., But here’s one thing I want to say about this, though, when you’re bringing American business people into the administration and they’ve had some level of success in this society, they have to unencumber themselves.  And it’s just a very interesting thing, and it’s somewhat ironic.  You want to go serve the country, and so the first thing you have to do is take on this mega-opportunity cost by getting rid of all your assets.  But I’m willing to do that because I love the country., John., Q    Anthony, you’ve been watching this White House from somewhat outside, and I’m sure you have your own perspective on what you’ve seen., MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Not quite as candid as you, though.  Not that outside., Q    Not quite.  What is the first thing you’re going to change to try to right this ship and put it on course?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Again, I take issue with that.  I think this ship is going to go — the ship is going in the right direction.  I think we’ve got to just radio signal the direction very, very clearly.  I like the team.  Let me rephrase that:  I love the team., And so I’m an incrementalist.  Most entrepreneurs you will find are incrementalists.  To say something overly bold or overly dramatic is unfair.  What good entrepreneurs do is they start the day and they go through the process.  The Navy SEALs will tell you that if you want to eat an elephant, you got to eat it one bite at a time.  And Sarah and I are going to do that together., Q    Anthony, did you have any hesitation taking this job knowing it might cause some friction and that it might lead to Sean leaving, which is what’s going to happen?  And the two are at least somewhat coincidental.  And did you have any hesitation about how you would relate to the rest of the White House staff if you came in under those circumstances?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Well, listen, remember I’m a business person.  And so what happens in business a lot of the times is you have some rotation in personnel as you’re making changes, and you have lifestyle choices that people are also making., I would love to have Sean here.  Sean decided that he thought it would be better to go.  And for me, as it relates to Sean, it speaks volumes to who he is as a human being, who he is as a team player, okay?, So his attitude is, if Anthony is coming in, let me clear the slate for Anthony.  And I do appreciate that about Sean, and I love him for it.  But I don’t have any friction with Sean.  I don’t have any friction with Reince.  This is the White House of the United States of America, and we’re serving the President.  And I want to make sure that our cultural template is that we put the President’s agenda first, which is perfect for the American people, and we serve his interests., And so if we have a little bit of friction inside the White House as a result of that, it’s okay.  We can all live with that.  I’m a business person.  I’m used to dealing with friction., Q    You were a significant player during the transition.  Was it disappointing that you did not land a post here from the get-go?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Again, I would say as an entrepreneur you have to be accustomed to setbacks.  I’ve had a series of setbacks in my life, which I’ve written about.  I wrote a best-selling book — and if you don’t believe me, you can come into my basement, I’ll show you every copy in order to get to be a best-selling book.  (Laughter.)  And so I’m very honest about mistakes that I’ve made and setbacks that I’ve had.  And so was I disappointed?  Yes.  I said that candidly that I was disappointed.  But I love the President, and I’m very, very loyal to the President.  And I love the mission that the President has, okay?  Since the early days of the campaign when I went to these rallies and I saw the love that the people had for the President, and I grew up in the middle class, and so there’s a struggle out there.  The President saw that before I did.  I wish I could tell you I saw it before him, but he taught it to me.  And I feel that struggle and have empathy for that struggle, and I want to be here to help him make things better for the American people., So I’ll talk into this.  Yes, sir.  I’m going to try to get to everybody.  I promise you I’ll try to get to everybody., Q    Sean told the AP and others that the President needed a clean slate.  How does that comport with a White House that’s headed in the right direction?  And secondly, how badly does the President need a win on healthcare in order to make progress?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Look, so here’s one problem with the way our society is working.  Right now we are micromanaging the seconds of the news cycle.  I predict that the President will get a win in healthcare.  That’s my honest prediction just because I’ve seen him in operation over the last 20-plus years.  The President has really good karma, okay?  And the world turns back to him.  He’s genuinely a wonderful human being, and I think as the members of Congress get to know him better and get comfortable with him, they’re going to let him lead them to the right things for the American people.  So I think we’re going to get the healthcare done., I also think we’re going to get tax reform done.  And whatever else is on the President’s agenda, we’re going to work very, very hard, very studiously here to make it happen., Jon., Q    So I see the cameras are back.  Will you commit now to holding regular on-camera briefings, Sarah?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  If she supplies hair and makeup, I will consider it, okay?  (Laughter.)  But I need a lot of hair and makeup, Jon.  I don’t know.  Maybe., Q    You’re going to be doing the briefing?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Not at all.  This is the press secretary.  I’m up here today only because I think it’s the first day.  We made a mutual decision that it would make sense for me to come up here and try to answer as many questions as possible.  And the answer is, we may.  I have to talk to the President about it.  I like consulting with the President before I make decisions like that., Go ahead, Jon.  Keep going., Q    And I know you’ve been one of the President’s strongest supporters for a while now.  But does he know what you said about him back in 2015, when you said he was a hack politician?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, he brings it up — he brings it up every 15 seconds, all right?  (Laughter.)  One of the biggest mistakes that I made because I was an unexperienced person in the world of politics; I was supporting another candidate; I should have never said that about him.  So, Mr. President, if you’re listening, I personally apologize for the 50th time for saying that., But here’s the wonderful thing about the news media:  That was three minutes of my life.  He’s never forgotten it, and you’ve never forgotten it.  But I hope that someday, Mr. President, you will forget it., Let’s go to the next question., Q    Can I ask you one more?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Go head, Jon., Q    There’s been a question about credibility, some things that have been said in this room.  Let me ask you a variation of what I asked Sean Spicer on his first day:  Is it your commitment to the best of your ability give accurate information, the truth from that podium?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  I sort of feel like I don’t even have to answer that question.  I hope you can feel that from me, just from my body language, that’s the kind of person I am.  I’m going to do the best I can., I’m going to get to everybody.  Go ahead., Q    Anthony, you mentioned your relationship with Reince.  Was he involved in offering you this position?  Was he consulted by the President ahead of time?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, he was consulted.  He was involved in the thing.  There’s a lot of speculation in the press about the timing and so on and so forth.  And so what I’m here to tell you is that we’re a team., Now if you —, Q    Can you walk us through how the job was offered?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Like I said, I think some of this stuff, it’s unnecessary to go into that granular detail because then — it’s almost like the book, The Circle, where you’re wearing like a police camera on you when you’re having conversations.  I don’t think that’s fair the President., But here’s what I tell you, okay?  I’m a team player.  I’ve played team sports my whole life — at least as a kid, and I believe that you have to subordinate yourself to the greater good of the team.  And if teammates don’t have disagreements about certain things, then they’re not going to get to the championship.  You got to get together and mix it up a little bit from time to time., I have no problem mixing it up with these guys.  I love these guys.  I respect these guys.  Is it perfect every single day?  Tell me whose life is perfect every single day., But here’s the commitment that I’m making to you and to the American people and to the President that I’m here to serve him, and I’m here to serve the people inside the West Wing., Q    Just a follow-up on Jon’s question, are you committed then to regular televised briefings and having a transparent relationship with the press?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Again, I obviously am committed to being transparent because I’m standing here.  But I’d like to talk that over with the President, and we’ve got a new press secretary.  I’d like to talk it over with her.  And then we’ll get back to you on that., But listen, I’m standing right here.  I’m going to try to answer every question., Sara, go ahead., Q    So two quick questions, the first one, obviously we know the President has been feeling under siege with the Russia investigations both at the Department of Justice but also on the Hill.  Do you feel like he was feeling exposed?  He didn’t have people adequately coming to his defense, is that part of the reason that we have you here today in the White House?, MR. SCARAMUCCI:  I don’t think so.  So one of the things that I’m doing today is I sort of didn’t have my White House Counsel briefing before I’m having a press briefing, so I’m want to limit my remarks related to the Russia situation and things like that., ...]

       "315  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:36 P.M. EST, MR. SPICER: Hey, guys. I brought a guest. Good afternoon. First off, at the top, I want to acknowledge that there’s been an additional wave of threats to Jewish community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices. According to some reports, there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions since the start of this year alone., As the President said at the beginning of his joint address, “We’re a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms. We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms.”, It is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you, and I share the President’s thoughts that he fervently hopes that we don’t continue to have to share these reports with you. But as long as they will — as long as they do continue, we’ll continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop them., Now, on to news of the day. You saw President Trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises: protecting the country against radical Islamic terrorism, and repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative., We talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the United States yesterday. And so, on to Obamacare. I’d like to introduce the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare., Dr. Price., SECRETARY PRICE: Thanks, Sean. Good afternoon. First, let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I’m the third physician out of 23 individuals who’ve had the privilege of serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And we take that mission very, very seriously., And for many Americans, right now, their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge. For most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It’s about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won’t be a penalty for not purchasing coverage. For the folks in the Medicare system, there will be no changes at all in the current law. But we’re talking about those people in the individual and small-group market, the moms and pops, the folks who run the corner grocery store, the corner cleaners. Those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverage., And then Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care, and we want to make certain that we address that., This is about patients. This is not about money. This is not about something else. This is about patients. And sadly, the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and small-group market. The access is going down, and it’s only getting worse. You know the stories. Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year, on average. Arizona had an increase of 116 percent. Deductibles are going up for many, many folks. If you’re a mom or a dad out there and you make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, your deductible in this market, in that individual and small-group market, oftentimes is $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 a year., What that means is you’ve got an insurance card but you don’t get care because you can’t afford the deductible. And we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the care., A third of the counties in the United States — one-third of the counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. One insurer is not a choice. So we need to make certain that we correct that., In Tennessee this morning, it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Insurers are leaving the market on the exchange. Last year there were 232 insurers that were providing coverage — that were offering coverage on the exchange; now there are 167. That’s a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone. And all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they need., Now, the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability, we want a system that’s affordable for everybody. Accessibility, we need a system that’s accessible for everybody. A system that’s of the highest quality, a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system, and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountability., The President spoke last week, last Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, and he laid out his principles. First, wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market. Nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosis., In terms of affordability, health savings accounts — growing choices for patients is incredibly important. Tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, not that the government forces them to buy. We’ve always talked about — in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place, that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage., Those, again, in the employer-sponsored market, they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage. Those folks that are out there in the individual and small-group market, no tax benefit. And that’s what this plan would do., State flexibility. It’s incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is, have the flexibility, especially in the Medicaid program, to be able to respond to their vulnerable population., Lawsuit abuse. The President mentioned, and it’s incredibly important, that — the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year, and we need to make certain that we’re addressing that as well. The President also talked about a glide path, an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country, and that’s important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks., Buying across state lines, buying insurance across state lines. The President talked about this on the campaign over and over. The American people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines, and it increases competition. And we need to make certain that that happens, and then addressing the incredible increase in drug prices., There are three phases of this plan. One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives. That’s the start of all of this. Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place. As you all well know, the previous administration used regulations to a fare-thee-well — in fact, there were 192 specific rules that were put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5,000 letters of guidance and the like. And we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients, then we need to continue them. If they harm patients or increase costs, then obviously they need to be addressed. And then there’s other legislation that will need to be addressed that can’t be done through the reconciliation process., So the goal of all of this is patient-centered healthcare, where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions, and not the federal government. We commend the House for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process., And I look forward to a few questions. Yes, sir., Q Mr. Secretary, you’re familiar from your time in the House with the clout that conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action have with rank-and-file members. What does it say about this legislation that these groups are already out with opposition to it?, SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the beginning of the process. And we look forward to working with them and others to make certain that, again, we come up with that process that aligns with the principles that we’ve defined that they actually adhere to or agree with as well, and that is that we need a system that’s affordable for folks, a system that’s accessible for individuals, that’s of the highest quality, that incentivizes innovation, and that empowers patients., And so we look forward to working with them through this process., Q Secretary, Congressman Chaffetz said today that Americans may need to forgo a new iPhone to pay for healthcare, and they’ll have to kind of make these choices. Does the administration agree with that? Will Americans under this plan — will they need to maybe sacrifice other goods to pay for their healthcare?, SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important question, because what’s happening right now is that the American people are having to sacrifice in order to purchase coverage. And, as I mentioned, many individuals can’t afford the kind of coverage that they have right now. So they’ve got that insurance card but they don’t have care., What our desire is, is to drive down the healthcare costs for everybody. And the way that you do that is to increase choices for folks, increase competition, return the regulation of healthcare where it ought to be, which is at the state level, not at the federal level. All of these things that, taken in their aggregate, will in fact decrease the costs of healthcare and health coverage, and that will allow folks to be able to purchase the coverage that they want., Yes, sir., Q Thank you, Dr. Price. I have two questions for you. First has to do with guarantees that you can make as the administration’s point person on this legislation. Can you guarantee that whatever legislation emerges and makes it to the President’s desk will allow individuals, if they like their doctor they can keep their doctor? And the second guarantee is, can you also guarantee that healthcare premiums for individuals will come down with this new legislation?, SECRETARY PRICE: Again, a remarkably important question because, as you’ll recall, the promise from the last administration was if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your plan you can keep your plan. Both of those promises turned out to be not true., We think it’s incredibly important for the American people to be able to select the physician and the place where they’re treated themselves, that the government ought not be involved in that process. And so our goal is absolutely to make certain that individuals have the opportunity to select their physician., In terms of premiums, we believe strongly that through this whole process and as it takes effect, that we’ll see a decrease in not only the premiums that individuals will see, but a decrease in the cost of healthcare for folks. Remember, that was another promise that the previous administration made, that you’d see a decrease in $2,500 on average for families across this land; in fact, what they’ve seen is an increase of $2,500 or $3,000., So we’re going to go in the other direction. We’re going to go in a direction that empowers patients and holds down costs., Yes., Q Mr. Secretary, you are quite a distance away from conservatives with this plan in the central part of it, which is tax credits, which they see as yet another entitlement, very similar to the entitlement of Obamacare but different in form. How do you convince them, since it’s going to take tax credits to make this work, that they need to swallow this and move forward with the bill? I mean, you’re getting an awful lot of opposition on the central tenet of this whole thing., SECRETARY PRICE: This is all about patients. And in order to provide that transition and in order to make it so that nobody falls through the cracks. We’ve got to have a system that allows for individuals to gain the kind of coverage that they want., And we, conservatives and others, have said for a long, long time that we believe it’s important to equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing coverage, gaining coverage through their employer, and those not. And the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to equalize that tax treatment. Folks have talked about this for many, many years, actually, so that there’s not a distortion in the tax code for who’s able to gain a benefit for being able to purchase coverage and not., Q Sir, Mr. Secretary, you were talking about making sure people don’t fall through the cracks. The last administration, with Obamacare, focused in on making sure the underserved were part of the equation. What is the safety net or the safeguard that you have to make sure — to ensure people don’t fall through the cracks beyond the tax incentives, but also for the underserved, who are now part of — many are now part of the program that weren’t before, prior to Obamacare., SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this is extremely important as well. And the current system, as you likely know, for those vulnerable in our population, especially in the Medicaid population, this is a system that’s broken. You’ve got a third of the physicians in this country — one-third of the doctors in this country that would be eligible to see Medicaid patients who aren’t seeing Medicaid patients right now. And it’s not because they’ve forgotten how to take care of patients, it’s because of the rules that are in place that make it too onerous or too difficult for them to see Medicaid patients., So we believe that it’s important to allow states to have that flexibility to fashion the program for their vulnerable population that actually responds to that population in a way that gives them the authority, them the choices, them the opportunity to gain coverage and the care that they believe most appropriate., Q What if you find out that that is not happening when you give it to the states? Is there some type of punishment or some type of piece that you’re going to put in place to make sure that that happens, that they follow through on your intent?, SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, absolutely. There’s accountability throughout the plan that we have that would allow for the Secretary and the Department to be certain that the individuals that we believe need to be cared for are being cared for in the state at the appropriate level. But we believe this is a partnership. This is about patients and partnership., The previous administration tended to make it about government. We believe it’s about patients and partnership, and we want to partner with every single person in this land who wants to make certain that we allow the kind of choices and quality to exist., Q The President tweeted earlier today. He described this bill as “our wonderful new healthcare bill.” There’s been a little bit of confusion. Does this represent the administration’s bill? And is there anything in this bill that the administration cannot support?, SECRETARY PRICE: This has been a work in progress. As you know, this has been going on for over a year. The work that I had the privilege of participating in when I served in the House of Representatives in the last Congress was open and transparent and we invited folks in to give their ideas. And tens, if not hundreds, of people had input into that process., This grew out of that, and over the past number of weeks, we’ve been having conversations with folks on the Hill, in the House and in the Senate, and other stakeholders. And so this is a work product that is a result of all of that process. The President and the administration support this step in the right — what we believe is in the right direction, a step that repeals Obamacare and gets us moving in the direction of those principles that I outlined., Q Do you support everything that’s in that bill that’s sitting on the table, sir? Do you support everything that’s in the bill sitting on the table, sir?, SECRETARY PRICE: This is a work in progress and we’ll work with the House and the Senate in this process. As you know, it’s a legislative process that occurs. I’m glad you pointed out the bill is on the table there. As you’ll see, this bill right here was the bill that was introduced in 2009 and ’10 by the previous administration. Notice how thick that is. Some of you will recall that I actually turned the pages and went through that piece of legislation in a YouTube. The pile on the right is the current bill., And what it means is that we are making certain that the process, that the decisions that are going to be made are not going to be made by the federal government. They’re going to be made by patients and families and doctors., One last —, Q Mr. Secretary, given the opposition that John and others have brought up here today, does this plan already need to be salvaged in your view? And how do you do it?, SECRETARY PRICE: Oh, no. You know what happens with these things. You start at a starting point, people engage and they get involved in the process, sometimes to a greater degree. Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that’s currently on the table and that has a — as a work in progress — or in process. And we’ll work through it., Q So this is a starting point here?, SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important process to be had. The American people have said to their elected leaders that the Obamacare process for them gaining coverage and care is not working. That’s what they’ve said. And so we believe it’s important to respond to the American people and provide a healthcare system that allows for them to purchase the kind of coverage and care that they desire., Yes., Q You said in your letter to the House chairman that necessary technical and appropriate changes might need to be made for this bill to reach the President’s desk. So what specific changes is the White House and the administration looking for in this bill?, SECRETARY PRICE: Well, as I mentioned, there are three different phases to this process. One is this bill, this legislation that’s working through under the rules of reconciliation, which is a fancy term to mean that there are only certain things that you can do from a budgetary standpoint has to affect either spending or revenue. There are things that you can’t do in this bill, and those we plan on doing across the horizon in phase two, which is the regulatory portion, and then in phase three, which is another piece of legislation that would be going through the House and the Senate with a majority — supermajority in the Senate., That process will incorporate all of the kinds of things that we believe are absolutely necessary to reconstitute that individual and small-group market and to get us in a position, again, where patients and families and docs are making these decisions., Q Mr. Secretary, bearing in mind that the CBO score isn’t back yet, can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on deficit or result in millions of Americans losing health insurance?, SECRETARY PRICE: What I can say is that the goal and the desire I know of the individuals on the Hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal government., Q Mr. Secretary, two elements of the bill. I have questions about how they control costs and how they help with access. The Medicaid per-capita block grant through the states, how is that sort of fundamentally different from the Obamacare regime on Medicaid in terms of expanding access?, And then the second point, why doesn’t this bill do away with the cost-sharing community ratings regime that Obamacare had?, SECRETARY PRICE: So the per-capita cap, Medicaid, again, is a system that doesn’t work for patients. You’ve got folks out there who need care, who need to see particular physicians who aren’t able to see them. All Americans should be saddened by the situation that we have when there are patients out there that can’t get the care that they need. We believe one of the keys to providing appropriate care in the Medicaid population is allowing the states to have the flexibility to address that Medicaid population., Remember, Medicaid population is four different demographic groups. It’s those who are disabled, it’s those who are seniors, it’s healthy moms and kids, by and large. Those are the four main demographic groups. And we, the federal government, force states, mostly, to take care of those individuals in exactly the same way. If you describe that to the folks back home on Main Street, they say, that doesn’t make any sense at all. You need a program that’s different for the healthy moms and kids to respond to their needs that’s different than folks who are disabled and seniors., And so what we believe is appropriate is to say to the states, you know your population best. You know best how to care for your vulnerable population. We’re going to watch you and make certain that you do so, but you know how to do that. And that will decrease costs markedly in the Medicaid program. We’re wasting significant amounts of money — not that folks are getting too much care, we’re wasting it because it’s inefficient and there’s significant abuse in the system., So in terms of the cost-sharing, I think that the cost-sharing measures are being addressed. It’s important that we run through that process. This is the process where we felt the previous administration was spending money that they didn’t have the authority to spend, and Congress is working through that to make certain that the rightful holders of the authority to spend money in this nation, which is the Congress of the United States, exercises that authority., Q How does the White House and you feel about the label “Trumpcare”?, SECRETARY PRICE: I’ll let others provide a description for it. I prefer to call it patient care. This is about patients at the end of the day. This isn’t about politicians. This isn’t about insurance companies. This is about patients. And patients in this nation, especially those in the individual and small-group market, these are the folks., I had the privilege of going to Cincinnati last week with the Vice President to a small-business roundtable. And one of the business owners, one of the small-business owners there, said he had 18 employees last year at this time. This year, he has 15 employees — not because he doesn’t have the work, but because of the cost of health coverage for those individuals forced him — forced him — to let three people go., Now, they’re being forced to let three people go because the federal government has put in place rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for folks in the individual and small-group market to provide coverage for their employees. This is a system that’s not working for people. So if we focus on the patients — I’ll call it patient care. If you focus on the patients, we’ll get to the right answer., Q Mr. Secretary, a major complaint — sorry — a major complaint of conservatives with phase one of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that it is missing a measure that would allow healthcare to be sold across state lines. Now, the President said this morning that that would be in either phase two or phase three. Is that something that you believe the President could do through executive action, and then you yourself could do? Or is that something that you believe has to be addressed legislatively?, SECRETARY PRICE: There are different aspects to the purchase across state lines that will allow individuals to gain, again, the kind of choices that they want. Some of this might be able to be done from a regulatory or a rules standpoint. Some of it will require legislation, and that’s where we’re going to need the assistance of our friends on the other side of the aisle., The American people have demanded that they be able to purchase coverage across state lines, purchase coverage that they want for themselves. So whether it’s through association health plans, which allows individuals who are in small-business groups, like the fellow that I just mentioned, to pool together nationally to be able to purchase coverage, or whether it’s mom and dad, who don’t gain coverage through their employer through something called individual health pools that allows folks to pool together solely for the purpose of purchasing coverage, even though they’re not otherwise economically aligned. That allows people — there are 18 million folks in that individual and small-group market. That would allow those individuals to be able to purchase coverage and get the purchasing power of millions. That’s huge power and authority that we want to put in the hands of people, that we want to put in the hands of patients. And some of that may, in fact, require legislation., Yes, sir., Q Mr. Secretary, thank you. Two questions but first, Congressman John Faso of New York has said that the issue of denying federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be separate from whatever healthcare bill finally emerges from Congress and is signed into law by the President. Is that the administration’s position as well?, And my second question is this. You mentioned earlier the people who had their healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they could keep it. I believe in your state of Georgia, more than a million people had that experience. Will some of the plans that were cancelled be able to come back under the new healthcare plan?, SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, in terms of Planned Parenthood, we think it’s important that the legislature work its will on this process. It’s incredibly important that we not violate anybody’s conscience. We want to protect the conscience provisions that exist. It’s also important to appreciate that through community health centers, the bill that’s being proposed right now would allow greater access for women to healthcare in greater numbers of facilities across this land. And they’ve actually proposed more money for women’s healthcare than currently exists. So I think that they’re working their best to address that issue., In terms of whether or not old plans that were available before might be available, absolutely. And we believe that the opportunity to provide a robust market, robust choices for individuals across this land will be secured. And, again, that’s one of the keys to bringing down the premium costs, of bringing down the cost for health coverage. So we’re excited about that and look forward to that coming to pass., Q If the new plan calls for repealing the revenue-generating taxes and penalties but keeping the entitlements, how is that sustainable?, SECRETARY PRICE: That’s the work that somebody mentioned over here — the Congressional Budget Office score, and once the Congress receives that score, then they’ll be working through that to make certain that in fact it is fiscally responsible., Imagine, if you would, however, a system where the incentives within the system are all to drive down costs, to provide greater choices and competition for folks, and respond to the specific needs of patients. And in so doing, what you do is actually get a much more efficient system for the provision and the delivery of healthcare. It’s a system we don’t have right now because the previous administration felt that the government — the federal government ought to do all of this. And we’ve seen what came about when the federal government does all of that — that it’s increasing premiums, increasing deductibles, decreasing choices. You’ve got a card that says you’ve got insurance, and you walk in, and you can’t afford what it is that’s trying to — for the doctor that’s trying to take care of you., So this is not a system that’s working for folks in that individual and small-group market and in the exchanges., Q Mr. Secretary, many have complained that Obamacare resulted in higher wait times in the emergency room. Will this new bill cause that? Have you have any idea on that?, SECRETARY PRICE: One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of healthcare, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite. And much of that is because of, again, the rules and the regulations that they put in place., So from our perspective, we believe that if individuals are able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, then they’ll have access to the kind of doctors and other providers that they desire, and won’t need to be able to be seen in the emergency room. They’ll already have the care. Emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies, not for the standard care that individuals tend to receive right now., So we believe that if you put in place the right system, then emergency rooms and emergency physicians will be able to have the opportunity to care for those individuals that appropriately present to their department., Q Mr. Secretary, I’m interested in following up on your comment that it’s important that no one vote on anything that violates their conscience. Federal funding already can’t be used for abortions, but are you saying that the administration has a position on provision of birth control at these community health centers? And secondly, is the administration looking to actively withhold funding to Planned Parenthood if they continue to provide abortions, as has been reported?, SECRETARY PRICE: We’re working through all of those issues. As you know, many of those were through the rule-making process and we’re working through that. So that’s not a part of this piece of legislation right here., Q But you don’t have a view on provision of birth control and access to it? When you’re talking about women’s healthcare, which you brought up, and saying you wanted to expand more community funding., SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, what we’re doing, as I say, is working through the rules and the regulations to see where the previous administration was, see how they did it, and whether or not it needs to be addressed. With the understanding that what we believe is important when we look at the rules and regulations is to define whether or not that rule or regulation actually helps patients and decreases costs, or harms patients and increases costs. If it does the latter, then we need to do away it. If it does the former, then we ought to accentuate it., Q What was the issue of conscience you were talking about? What was the issue of conscience you were talking about then?, SECRETARY PRICE: To make certain that individuals in the market are not forced to do things that violate their conscience., Yes, sir., Q Secretary, thank you, sir. Common people and the small businesses have been waiting for this new bill under President Trump. So any message, sir, for them?, SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the culmination of years of work. It’s the culmination of years of concern and frustration by the American people. They knew at the time that the previous bill — the previous law passed that it wasn’t going to help them. They knew that costs were going to go up. In fact, we predicted at the time that costs would go up and that access would go down. And so this is the culmination of years of hard work by the electorate, by the citizens of this country to say that we want a system, again, that respects patients and families and doctors in these decisions., One more., ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "316  [Loews Atlanta Hotel, \\nAtlanta, Georgia, 4:46 P.M. EDT, THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Georgia! (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. Thank you for those great words. Thank you for your great leadership here in Georgia. It is great to be back in the Peach State. (Applause.), In fact, last Saturday, my family and I actually celebrated St. Paddy’s Day in the great city of Savannah, Georgia. (Applause.) And today, I’m honored to be here in Atlanta, with the men and women who helped elect a President and leaders in Congress who, just three months ago yesterday, enacted historic tax cuts to put America first. You did it, Georgia. (Applause.), And, in fact, let me begin today by bringing greetings from a friend of mine. When I left the Oval Office today, I could tell he was just a little bit jealous about where I was headed. And he wanted me to tell all of you that he loves Georgia. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We love Georgia., And I’m here today to talk about the progress that we’ve all made together over the past year. But before I get started, let me take a moment to acknowledge that Georgia lost one of its greatest leaders today — Zell Miller., Zell was a leader of great character and great integrity. He dedicated his life to public service and to serving this country. He was a United States Marine, a governor, a United States senator. And the difference he made in the life of this great state and the life of this nation will impact this country for generations to come., Zell Miller was a great champion of public education, and, as governor, he helped establish the HOPE Scholarship that opened so many doors of opportunity for students across this state., And above all, Zell was a proud Georgian, and he always put the interests of the hardworking men and women of Georgia first, even when it wasn’t popular within his own political party. He remains an inspiration not just to the people of Georgia, but to leaders all across this country, on this day., So let me say our prayers are with his family and all those who love, and cherish, and admire this great man. And I know I speak for all of Georgia when I say that Zell Miller will be missed. He was a great Georgian. He was a great American. And we will long remember the life and legacy and contributions of Zell Miller. (Applause.) Thank you for that., And to Governor Deal, thank you for that wonderful introduction and for your lifetime of leadership and service to the great state of Georgia. (Applause.) I actually had the chance to get to know your governor when we both served in Congress together., But his two terms as governor have left the Peach State stronger, and safer, and more prosperous than ever before in the history of this state. Seven-hundred thousand new jobs in seven years is an incredible record. Would you all mind getting on your feet and showing the 82nd governor of the great state of Georgia and his wonderful wife, Sandra, just how much we appreciate their leadership and the difference that they’ve made in Georgia. (Applause.), And with us today are also three other friends of mine, and great friends of our President, leaders in the House of Representatives who work every day to put Georgia first and to put America first: Representatives Karen Handel, Rob Woodall, and Barry Loudermilk. (Applause.) Where are you?, I also want to recognize a special guest you just heard from a few minutes ago. I gave him a ride here. (Laughter.) He is a great champion of American workers and of freedom in the marketplace. He’s working tirelessly to unleash American energy at the EPA. Join me in thanking our EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt one more time. He is a great, great leader. (Applause.), And finally — finally, I’d like to thank the host of today’s event who brought us all together, an organization that’s fighting to promote the policies that are making a real difference — a real difference in the life of the state of Georgia and our entire nation. Join me in thanking America First Policies for bringing us all together on a Friday afternoon. (Applause.), You know, I’m here in the Peach State today, first and foremost, just to say thank you. Thank you, Georgia. Thank you for everything you’ve done to stand with our administration, not only in that election in 2016, but in every day since. Because of your support and your hard work, it’s been a year of action; it’s been a year of results. In a word, it’s been a year of promises made and promises kept. (Applause.), Even earlier today, in the spending bill the President signed into law, we saw the promises of this administration kept, one after another. As the President made clear, under this bill, the government, unfortunately, is still too big and still spends too much., Now, the bill wasn’t perfect, but you all deserve to know it is chock-full of examples of how this President fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of Georgia and to the American people. And it all begins with providing for the common defense. National defense is now the top priority — (applause) — of this country and this administration., You know, President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy. And just a few hours ago, I was standing nearby when President Donald Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense in American history. (Applause.), The President promised to increase take-home pay for men and women who wear the uniform of the United States –- and he did just that. The largest pay increase for our armed forces in nearly 10 years signed into law today. (Applause.), You know, and today, I can tell from where I’m standing that we’re joined by an awful lot of heroes in this room. In fact, there’s a group of heroes from Dobbins Air Reserve Base and Robins Air Force Base here in Georgia, who serve in the United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Would you all just mind showing these men and women in uniform how much we appreciate them stepping up to defend our nation? (Applause.), You know, and it isn’t just those on active duty the President promised to support; he also promised to support America’s veterans. And I’m pleased to report to you, in the bill that he just signed — (applause) — we gave the Department of Veterans Affairs the resources they need to completely eliminate the backlog for veterans once and for all. (Applause.) And we are going to make sure our veterans get the support and the healthcare in real time that they earned in the uniform of the United States., Our President also promised to protect our homeland and secure our borders. As I stand before you today, I’m pleased to report that in a little more than a year, illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut nearly in half. And with the $1.6 billion of funding in the bill just signed into law, the United States will immediately begin construction of nearly 100 miles of a new border wall. (Applause.) And let me make you a promise: When it comes to the wall, we’re going to build it all. (Applause.), You know, the President also promised to appoint strong conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And this President not only appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States, but he also set a record of the most court of appeal judges confirmed in a single year in American history, and they’re all conservative men and women that are going to make you proud. (Applause.), President Trump also promised to stand with America’s men and women in law enforcement. And I promise you today, with resources in this legislation and with respect, we once again are giving the men and women who wear the uniform of law enforcement and public safety the resources and respect they deserve. (Applause.), So it’s about strength abroad, strength on our borders, but it’s also about safety and security here at home in our neighborhoods, our homes, and our schools, where it matters most., All of our hearts are still broken in the wake of the terrible shootings that have beset communities in recent days, and claimed innocent lives. You know, our President promised, in the wake of the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that this time America would take action because no child should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever fear for the safety of their child when they drop them off at school in the morning., And I’m pleased to report to you that the legislation signed today includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, it bolsters and improves our criminal background check system, and gives parents and schools new tools and new resources to keep our kids safe. (Applause.), President Trump also promised to do more than any administration to combat a crisis that’s impacting families here in Georgia and all across this country — the scourge of opiate abuse and addiction. Unfortunately, no community, large or small, that hasn’t been impacted., And the legislation just signed today will actually invest a record amount, more than any time in history — $6 billion to end this epidemic. And as President Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire earlier this week, “We will make this the generation that ends the scourge of opiate addiction in America.” (Applause.), He promised to rebuild America. And I’m also happy to report to you, in the bill just signed — the Governor will be happy about this, too — we’ve got another $21 billion to rebuild our infrastructure. And that includes $50 million for that expansion project at the Port of Savannah, which is so critical to the growth and prosperity of this state of Georgia. (Applause.), Now, as the President said today, this bill is far from perfect. I mean, the truth is, the processes we have in Congress these days don’t allow for perfection. In fact, the President said today, it’s “no way to run a government.” (Laughter.), That’s why President Trump is calling on Congress, starting today, to give this President the same authority that 44 governors have all across this country. The time has come to give the President of the United States of America the line-item veto, so the President can fund the priorities of the American people and protect American taxpayers at the same time. (Applause.), So since day one of this administration, we’ve been working hard to keep the promises that we made to the people of Georgia. And when you look at the record, over the last 14 months, it has been a record of promises made and promises kept. And it’s so humbling for me to be a part of it., Now, when you talk about all that we’ve done together — I came here today to really talk about what’s happening in this economy. I mean, from early in this administration, we’ve been working with these great members of Congress to roll back the heavy hand of government on businesses large and small., In fact, I remember back on the campaign trail, and maybe some of you do too, the President promised that he would repeal two federal regulations for every one new federal rule put on the books. The truth is, we didn’t do that. With the support of our leaders in Congress, and the majorities in the House and the Senate, we’ve repealed 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the federal book. It’s true. (Applause.) In fact, President Trump has signed more laws, rolling back federal red tape already than any President in American history. (Applause.), \\nWe promised to provide the American people relief from the disaster known as Obamacare. You know, today is actually the 8th anniversary of that failed law. And I’m happy to report to you that, last December, the President signed legislation to repeal the Obamacare individual mandate. It’s gone. It’s off the books. (Applause.), We promised to unleash American energy. And this President, from early on, approved the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. We rolled back the Clean Power Plan. And as you just heard Scott Pruitt say, President Trump put America first when he withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.), We promised to crack down on unfair — we promised to crack down on unfair trade practices, as well. The President has taken decisive action to protect our steel and aluminum and forestry industries. And I’ll make you a promise: Under President Donald Trump, the era of economic surrender is over. (Applause.) We are going to demand our trading partners give us fair and free and reciprocal trade that puts American workers first., And finally, what brought us all here today on a Friday afternoon, taking a break from watching basketball — (laughter) — is that this President promised to cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses and family farms. And three months ago yesterday, with the strong support of these great leaders in the Congress, and with the support of every Georgia Republican in the House of Representatives, President Donald Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. That’s promises made and promises kept. (Applause.), You know, we’re just over a year into our administration and the results are nothing short of remarkable. Because of your support, because of the leadership that you supported — from the Oval Office to Capitol Hill to the State House here in Georgia — since our election, American businesses have created nearly 3 million new jobs, including 40,000 new jobs in the Atlanta area alone. And unemployment in America hasn’t been this low in 17 years., In February alone, the American economy actually created 313,000 new jobs in a single month. It was the best month for construction and manufacturing in 20 years. (Applause.) In fact, the only sector of the economy to lose jobs in the month of February was the federal government. (Applause.), I mean, here in the Peach State, thanks to the actions of our administration and the strong support of your representatives in Congress, and thanks to seven years of Governor Nathan Deal’s leadership, Georgia’s economy is booming as never before., For five years running, Georgia has been ranked the best state in America to do business. And today, 17 Fortune 500 companies call Georgia home. (Applause.) And since our inauguration, unemployment in the Atlanta area has fallen by nearly 20 percent. And when it comes to the good-paying jobs that make Georgia great, since Election Day 2016, businesses across this state have created over 23,000 new jobs in manufacturing and construction., You know what? You look around Georgia; you look around America. Because of the leadership that you’ve supported, growth is back; confidence is back. In a word, America is back with President Donald Trump in the White House. (Applause.) It’s exciting., But as the President likes to say, at this White House, that’s just what we call a good start. (Laughter.) Because the truth is, we believe the best days for American prosperity are yet to come because these tax cuts are just starting to make a difference., I mean, think about it. I mean, we cut taxes for Georgia’s working families so you could keep more of your hard-earned money. We cut taxes for Georgia’s businesses so they can compete and win with companies anywhere around the world. We cut taxes for Georgia’s farmers, too. And all of those tax cuts are only now actually beginning to take effect in the economy. So for everything that we’re seeing happening, men and women of Georgia, it’s only just begun., You know, earlier this week, on National Agriculture Day, I was over at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And there’s a great champion for rural America — you might have heard from him — a guy by the name of Sonny Perdue, who is now the Secretary of Agriculture for the United States of America. (Applause.), I mean, the truth is, in this White House, we know that agriculture is the essence of America. That’s why, working with your leaders in Congress, with all the tax cuts that we passed, we also essentially eliminated the death tax for nearly every American farmer. And now farmers can deduct up to 100 percent of the cost of new equipment for the next five years. (Applause.) That’s an affirmation of how important agriculture is to the American economy., You know, all told, when you put it all together in a pile, we believe our tax cuts are going to save the typical family of four here in Georgia more than $2,200 a year when they all take effect., But it’s not just about lower taxes, remember that. It’s also bigger paychecks. It’s about bigger paychecks that come from businesses investing in American jobs and in American workers., In fact, we believe workers in Georgia can expect to see pay raises of more than $4,000 in the years ahead when these tax cuts all take effect., And we’re already on the way. You know, in just the past three months, businesses large and small across this state have already announced plans to pay their workers more, to hand out bonuses, to provide better benefits for more than 75,000 Georgia workers, including bonuses here in Atlanta as high as $2,000 a person., Folks, that’s great news for working families. I mean, a thousand-dollar bonus in the pocket of a working family makes a real difference. But not everybody thinks that. (Laughter.), I mean, you might have heard that the woman that wants to be Speaker of the House again, Nancy Pelosi, said a thousand-dollar bonus at the end of the year was just “crumbs.” Did you hear that term?, Now, I would like to remind you, humbly, I come from the Joseph A. Bank wing of the West Wing of the White House. (Laughter.) You with me on that? (Laughter.) Okay, good., When our kids were little — when our kids were little, and Karen was at home with the kids, I mean, we had a term for an extra thousand dollars in our paycheck at the end of the year: Christmas. (Applause.) Am I right?, I mean, these bonuses and pay raises are making a real difference in the lives of America’s working families. And I want to say very seriously: Any leader who says $1,000 in the pockets of working families is “crumbs” is out of touch with the American people. (Applause.), So let me just take a moment for the people that have been making that difference, supporting the President — your leaders in Congress who stood with the President for these tax cuts and so much more of what we’re talking about here today., I want to thank your two great senators -– Senator Johnny Isakson and Senator David Perdue — for their strong, conservative leadership in the United States Senate. (Applause.), And you’ve already heard from three extraordinary members of Georgia’s delegation in the House of Representatives –- Karen Handel, Rob Woodall, and Barry Loudermilk. They are remarkable people, and I’m just so grateful for their support. (Applause.), But, you know, I’m happy to report they might be the only ones here, but they’re not alone among Georgia’s Republicans. I’m pleased to report to all of you gathered here today that this agenda that we’re celebrating, the accomplishments that we’ve been able to bring about — I’m pleased to report to you that every single Republican in the Georgia delegation to Congress voted for the tax cuts and voted to put Georgia and America first. (Applause.) Every step of the way, they were with us., But, you know, for all that we’ve accomplished, the truth is, we still have more work to do. And in case you didn’t notice, first off, remember that Georgia elected a builder to be President of the United States, and this President is going to rebuild America’s roads and bridges and infrastructure and ports, and give us the best infrastructure in the world. (Applause.), This year, we’re also going to keep working to fix a broken immigration system that puts the best interests of American workers and American families first. (Applause.), We’re going to continue to do everything — we’re going to do everything in our power to confront the scourge of opiate addiction in this country. I promise each and every one of you that. And we’re going to work our hearts out., We’re working on developing non-addictive painkillers to cut opiate prescriptions. The goal is to cut opiate prescriptions by one-third over the next three years so we can prevent Americans from even becoming addicted in the first place., And we’re going to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, first and foremost, by working to reduce the availability of them. And secondly, we’re going to crack down. We’re going to crack down on drug dealers, we’re going to crack down on sanctuary cities. We’re going to secure our border. And we’re going to get tougher on people that are selling drugs to our kids. (Applause.), And, as the President said, that toughness — “that toughness includes the death penalty.” And our administration is going to be working — (applause) — every opportunity the law allows to bring the maximum penalty against those who profit by the drug trade., As the President said on Monday, and I say to all of you, “Failure is not an option. Addiction is not our future.” And we’re going to do whatever it takes, as I said before, to make this the generation that ends the opiate crisis in America., Folks, President Trump and I are just going to keep on delivering. We’re going to keep on delivering on the promises that we made to the good people of Georgia, with your support and with your help., But the President and I know that, for all the progress that we have made, it’s really not a reflection so much of what happens in the marbled halls of Washington, D.C.; that we both know that the strength of this country is found in the hearts, and the character, and the work ethic, and the patriotism of the American people., I mean, America is coming back. The resilience of America is now obvious not just to our fellow citizens, but to the wider world, because the American people are shining forth. By letting people keep more of what they earn, by getting the government out of the way, by making the right investments in ways that support a growing America, America is standing tall again. You see that resilience., And, of course, you have seen that same resilience in the history of this storied city of Atlanta, Georgia. It’s amazing to think just a few miles from here stands a monument that literally captures the essence of this city’s history -– “Atlanta from the Ashes.”, It shows a phoenix rising from the ashes, as you all well now, because that’s exactly what Atlanta had done over the past century and a half. This city was destroyed over 150 years ago, but that wasn’t the end of its history; it was just the beginning of a new history. And because of the resilience of your people and the determination, and the vision, and the faith of the people of Atlanta, this city has risen to become not one of the leading cities of the South, not one of the leading cities of America — this is one of the most dynamic cities in the world. (Applause.), The country looks on in Atlanta — it really does — and watches with inspiration that spirit that has defined this great city over the last century and a half. But no matter what challenges you face, Atlanta continues to reach greater heights every day. And the country is proud, and I know Georgia is proud., That’s the Atlanta spirit for you. It’s evident in every part of this city, and I see it — I see it from where I’m standing in this room today., But as I close today, I encourage you to take that spirit from this gathering, and talk about what you’ve heard here today. And I appreciate you coming out today on a Friday afternoon — a beautiful Friday here in Georgia. It was a lot colder where I left. (Laughter.) And it was a lot colder up in New Hampshire., But I want you to leave here today and I hope you’ll stay involved, stay engaged. Everything that we’ve accomplished, we’ve accomplished because of all of you. I really — I didn’t come here today — and I know these members of Congress feel the same way — to point to Washington and what they’ve done. But I came here today to talk about what you’ve done. Because of the President you elected, because of the leaders in the Congress that you’ve elected, because of the agenda that you supported, this country is coming back — coming back stronger and safer and more prosperous than ever before. And we’re just, really, getting started., So leave here today, and I just encourage you to go out and tell the story to your friends, your loved ones, and your neighbors. I mean, tell them what they’re not hearing on most of their cable television stations about all the good things that are happening in America. Tell them what we’ve accomplished. Say, “You know what? I ran into Mike the other day” — (laughter) — “and he was talking about all this stuff that’s happened in this country, all the things that we’ve accomplished together as Americans to revive and restore this nation, and to restore American credibility and strength on the world’s stage.”, And say, “I just wanted to tell you about it. And tell you about the difference that it’s making in the life of our city, and our state, and our nation.” I mean, go out there and tell them — tell them we cut their taxes so they can keep more of what they earn. Tell them that we’re restoring American strength at home and abroad, so their families can sleep safe at night. Tell them that we’re putting America back to work for them, not the other way around. And tell them that under President Donald Trump, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. Get out there and tell them. (Applause.) Tell them, Georgia. Because it’s true. You tell them., And I think Election Day surprised a few people. (Laughter and applause). And we’ve been surprising them ever since, haven’t we? (Applause.) Because Americans have been talking to each other. People have been seeing these results. They’ve been seeing commonsense, conservative principles put into practice that have put America first., So I just encourage you to stay engaged and to keep telling your neighbors and friends all the good things that are happening here and how the leadership in Georgia and the leadership you’re sending to Washington and the leadership of their President is making a difference in their lives., And, if you’re of a mind, in these challenging times where it seems like there’s too much division in these United States of America, I’d encourage you to maybe do one more thing. You know, there’s an old verse that Americans have clung to throughout our nation’s history, and it’s been true for millennia, and I still believe it’s true today. It says, if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll hear from heaven, and He’ll heal their land. (Applause.) And I truly believe that if we pray for America, that God will heal this one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Applause.) So pray for America. And pray for all who’s serving each and every day., So thanks for being here today. Thank you for the opportunity to address you. I look forward to saying hello to as many of you as can linger afterwards. And I leave here today with renewed confidence — I really do — that with the continued support of the good people of Georgia, with the continued great leadership that your state has, people like Governor Nathan Deal, with these great Georgian leaders in the Congress of the United States fighting for you every day, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, I know in my heart we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase — (laughter) — we will make America great again., Thank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless Georgia. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.), END 5:20 P.M.







                                                                             \n",
       "317  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:39 P.M. EDT, SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Welcome back.  Today, the President and First Lady welcome President Emmanuel Macron and Mrs. Macron to the White House, beginning the first state visit for the Trump administration.  This visit will celebrate the long and enduring friendship between France and the U.S.  Discussions will include economic, diplomatic, and global issues., The First Lady has taken an active role in every detail and planning of the visit, including the state dinner, which will be held tomorrow evening.  And we’re looking forward to a very successful state visit., As you all saw, we now have three Democrat senators who have announced they will vote to confirm Mike Pompeo, President Trump’s highly qualified nominee for Secretary of State.  However, a majority of Democrats continue their pointless obstruction to score cheap political points with their base as a willful attempt to undermine American diplomacy., Regardless, the President is looking forward to Mike Pompeo’s confirmation so he can continue doing an incredible job on behalf of the American people., I also want to commend the heroic actions of James Shaw Jr. early Sunday morning at a Waffle House in Tennessee.  Mr. Shaw saved lives when he wrestled a gun from an active shooter who had opened fire.  The President offers his condolences to the victims and their families.  He is monitoring the ongoing situation and the White House is in regular contact with state and local officials., Finally, I want to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their third child, a baby boy.  And from one mother to another, I know the reality of being outnumbered can be very scary, but I know she and Prince William will continue to be amazing parents.  So congratulations to them., And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Jonathan., Q    Sarah, on North Korea: Is the President willing to accept anything short of complete denuclearization before lifting any sanctions?, SANDERS:  Certainly the goal is denuclearization of the Peninsula, and we’re going to continue the maximum pressure campaign that has been ongoing to North Korea until we see concrete actions taken towards complete and total denuclearization., Q    But does that mean no sanctions lifted until that’s achieved?  Are you willing to go incrementally?, SANDERS:  Certainly no sanctions lifted until we see concrete actions taken by North Korea to denuclearize, Q    When the President said in his tweet that they had agreed to denuclearize, where did they do that?  Have they already agreed to do that?, SANDERS:  Certainly in a number of the conversations, including the comments, I’d refer you back to also South Korean President Moon, who has said that North Korea has expressed a will for complete denuclearization.  And certainly that’s the focus of any conversation and negotiation that the United States will have with North Korea., Steve., Q    Sarah, to what extent will the Iran nuclear deal come up in the conversation between the President and President Macron?  And what does President Trump want to hear from Macron on this thing?, SANDERS:  Look, I’m not going to get ahead of any conversations that we expect to take place over the next couple of days.  As you know, they just landed a few minutes ago, and haven’t even arrived here at the White House.  I’m not going to presume what those conversations will look like.  We certainly expect that that will be part of the conversation, and we’ll keep you posted if we have any specific details to put out about that., Q    And is the President still leaning towards decertifying the deal when it comes up again on May 12th?, SANDERS:  I don’t have any announcements on that front, but the President has been extremely clear that he thinks it’s a bad deal.  That certainly has not changed., Jim., Q    Wanted to ask you a question, sort of following up on what you were asked this morning about Michael Cohen.  It was noticed by some that you didn’t close the door one way or the other on the President pardoning Michael Cohen.  What is your read on that right now?, SANDERS:  It’s hard to close a door on something that hasn’t taken place.  I don’t like to discuss or comment on hypothetical situations that may or may not ever happen.  I would refer you to personal attorneys to comment on anything specific regarding that case, but we don’t have anything at this point., Q    And can I just ask you about a tweet that the President put out last week?  He tweeted a lot over the weekend.  But last week, he said — he was talking about sanctuary cities in California and saying, “There is a Revolution going on in California.  Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept.”, We haven’t had a chance to ask you about that tweet.  When he used the word “breeding,” was he making a derogatory term about Latinos in California — that they breed a lot or that they’re prone to breeding?  Was he talking about —, SANDERS:  No, he’s talking about the problem itself growing and getting bigger., Q    What does that mean though?, SANDERS:  Sorry, I’ve answered a couple., Justin, go ahead., Q    I also wanted to follow up on a couple of the President’s tweets.  The first was earlier this morning.  I’m wondering if you could explain the President’s tweet that he had ordered DHS not to allow large caravans of individuals into the country.  So if you can say both what specifically he ordered DHS to do, and what that would mean for individuals claiming refugee status within the United States., SANDERS:  Look, the President continues to monitor the ongoing situation.  A sovereign nation that cannot defend its borders will no longer be a sovereign nation.  The Trump administration is committed to enforcing our immigration laws, whether people are part of the caravan or not.  If you enter the United States illegally, let me be clear — you’ve broken the law, and we will enforce the law through prosecution of illegal borders., While we are committed to doing everything we can on the border to secure our nation, we need Congress to do their job as well, and to pass legislation to close the legal loopholes and prevent us from securing our borders and protecting Americans., Q    And then in the other tweet that the President did over the weekend, he said that he didn’t see Michael Cohen flipping to get out of trouble with the government.  I guess that prompts two questions.  The first is, what the President believes his personal attorney might have done to get him in trouble with the government.  And secondly, what the President has done that he is worried Michael Cohen could flip about., SANDERS:  The President has been clear that he hasn’t done anything wrong.  I think we’ve stated that about a thousand times.  Beyond that, I don’t have anything to add beyond the President’s tweet., Matthew., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  There have been a number of documented cases in the press recently of EPA Administrator Pruitt at least appearing to be dishonest about requesting raises for aides, about his relationship with a lobbyist who had business before the EPA (inaudible).  Is the White House concerned at all about this pattern?  And is there concern about him testifying before Congress on Thursday, as scheduled, where these issues are probably going to come up?, SANDERS:  We’re continuing to review a number of the reports that you mentioned, and we’ll let you know if we have any changes on that front., Ashley., Q    Sarah, President Macron is hoping that a proposed side deal between the U.S. and European powers could strengthen the Iran deal enough that President Trump would feel comfortable staying in it.  So is that sort of a fool’s errand?  And the President has said it’s a bad deal.  Does he believe there’s anything that could be done to fix it in a way he’d be comfortable with?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of any potential conversations that are going to take place over the next couple of days.  But as the administration has policy announcements, we’ll be sure to share them with you., Mara., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Just to go back to Jonathan’s question about North Korea, the President tweeted pretty flatly, “…they have agreed to denuclearization.”  And then, you’re saying that they just agreed to talk about it.  What is the President’s definition of complete denuclearization?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to negotiate with you guys.  I’m going to leave that to the President and Kim Jong-un to walk through what some of those details would look like when that meeting takes place.  But I can be very clear that we expect it not to just be mentioned in words, but there have to be concrete actions that take place towards total denuclearization of the Peninsula., Q    Does that mean removing all nukes — our nukes and theirs?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get into the negotiations of what will take place and what the agreement will look like.  But there have to be concrete actions that stop the denuclearization of the Peninsula., Q    Sarah, President Macron appears to have a very robust agenda coming to Washington.  He wants to change the President’s mind on a lot of different things — on the Iran nuclear deal, on keeping U.S. troops in Syria, on tariffs, and maybe even on the Paris Climate Accord.  Does he have an open mind?  Is it possible that he will change his mind after President Macron gets through with him?, SANDERS:  I think that I feel very confident that we have the best negotiator at the table.  Look, you have two leaders that have an incredibly good —, Q    So there’s a great negotiator and not-such-a-great negotiator., SANDERS:  Hold on, let me finish.  Let me finish.  That’s not what I said.  I said that we have a great negotiator at the table.  I certainly was not commenting on President Macron’s abilities; simply stating the obvious, that we have an incredibly good negotiator at the table for the United States., But what you do have are two leaders who have a great deal of respect for one another, who have a great friendship.  Certainly, both have a great deal of interest in doing what is best for their country, but being able to have very open and candid conversations because of the relationship not only that the leaders have built, but that has existed between the two countries long before either of these individuals arrived on the scene.  And we’re going to continue that relationship.  But I think we can expect this to be a very productive and very positive state visit for both countries., Q    Positive for France?, SANDERS:  I said for both countries., Q    Could the the President change his mind on some of these things?, SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of conversations that are going to take place.  But as we have any policy announcements, I’m sure you guys will be the first to know., Q    His mind is open?, SANDERS:  Again, the President wants to make good deals for this country.  And if he feels like he can make a good deal that benefits this country, he certainly is going to engage in those conversations., Peter., Q    Sarah, why should North Korea believe that the U.S. is an honest broker, when the President has said publicly that he would like to get out of the deal the U.S. and others made with Iran?, SANDERS:  Look, the President has been clear from day one that he thinks that’s a bad deal.  I don’t think any deal that he would sign and agree to he would consider a bad deal.  The President wants to do what is in the best interest —, Q    So he would never backtrack on this deal?, SANDERS:  The President wants to do what is in the best interest of our country and even in the world.  And particularly having North Korea and the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons, I think, is a good thing for everybody, and I think even you would be hard-pressed to find something different., Q    Sarah, beyond what you said about —, SANDERS:  Sorry, Peter, I’ve got tight time and I’m going to keep moving., Steve., Q    Yeah, Sarah, I just want to follow up on that about North Korea.  I’m wondering, what gives you any optimism that the North Koreans are really looking to denuclearize?  Because of the statements that they’re making, everybody seems to be jumping on the very positive aspects of the statements.  But they were also saying over the weekend that their completion of the nuclear arsenal, which they call their “powerful treasured sword,” firmly guarantees forever the country’s security and well-being.  That doesn’t sound like any wiggle room on denuclearization., SANDERS:  Certainly, we’re not going to make mistakes from previous administrations, and we’re not going to take the North Koreans simply at their word.  Like I said before and we’ve said many times before, the maximum pressure campaign is going to continue until we see concrete actions taken by — look, we’re not naïve in this process.  We’ve seen some steps in the right direction.  But we have a long way to go., We also have seen a major change in what has taken place in the past by having our allies and partners in the region step up and do much more than they have in the past.  China has taken a more active role in putting pressure on North Korea.  They can certainly do more — we hope they will — and will continue working with us.  And that’s all at the direction and because of the relationship that the President has built with President Xi of China., Yamiche., Q    I have two quick questions.  The first one is, that the New York Times and others reported that federal prosecutors have recommended charges against the New York police officer involved in Eric Garner’s death.  But the Justice Department has expressed some strong reservations.  Where do things stand with the case of Eric Garner, and when does the Justice Department — when are they going to make a decision about the police officer and whether or not they’re going to charge him?, SANDERS:  I don’t have an administration update on that front, but would refer you to the Department of Justice to get further details.  And I’ll work on getting an update for you and let you know., Q    And the second question I have is the President tweeted —, Q    Can you let all of us know?, SANDERS:  Sure.  Usually when we let one, it’s kind of a — it’s not exactly a secret.  But, yeah, I’d be happy to share that with everybody., Q    The second question is the President tweeted, “James Comey illegally classified documents to press in order — leaked documents to press [in order] to generate a Special Council?  Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act?  Really, does everyone know what that means?”  What does the President think that means?  And is he indicating that the Special Counsel should be fired because of the way that it was begun?, SANDERS:  As we’ve said many times before, we have no intention of firing the Special Counsel.  We’ve been beyond cooperative with them.  We’re continuing to cooperate with them.  Turned over nearly — over a million pages and documents to the Special Counsel and have been cooperative., Q    So what does it mean?, SANDERS:  Exactly what the President has been saying all along —, Q    Yeah, but the question that he posed?, SANDERS:  — that this was a false premise that this entire thing started on.  We continue to repeat that we think that the idea that the Trump campaign was involved in any collusion with Russia is a total witch hunt.  Our position on that has been very clear since the beginning of this process, and the President is echoing exactly what that position is., Jon., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Over the weekend, a fourth House Republican called for the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to step down.  He said he’s the wrong fit for the EPA.  What’s your reaction to that?, SANDERS:  Again, we’re reviewing some of those allegations.  However, Administrator Pruitt has done a good job of implementing the President’s policies, particularly on deregulation; making the United States less energy-dependent and becoming more energy independent.  Those are good things.  However, the other things certainly are something that we’re monitoring and looking at and I’ll keep you posted., Q    Last week, Andrew Wheeler was confirmed by the Senate.  He is Scott Pruitt’s deputy at the EPA.  Couldn’t he easily implement all of the President’s agenda if Scott Pruitt stepped aside?  He wouldn’t have a dark cloud hanging over the agency.  What’s your view on that idea?, SANDERS:  We’re very excited that the Democrats have finally allowed another one of our nominees to go through.  We hope that they’ll allow some of the other several hundred that sit waiting to be confirmed — very highly qualified individuals — we hope that they’ll continue to follow in the footsteps of that, and get a lot more people within this administration working., Blake., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  On the Iran nuclear deal, President Macron said don’t leave if there’s not a better option, and then the Iranian Foreign Minister tweeted today, “President Macron is correct in saying there’s no ‘Plan B’…  It’s either all or nothing.”  So my question to you is, does the White House believe that there is actually a realistic “Plan B” out there?, SANDERS:  We certainly think that there should be a better deal, one that actually is positive, that works.  And we don’t really typically look to the leadership in Iran to determine what our foreign policy is., Q    And then later today, on Mike Pompeo —, SANDERS:  Sorry, I’m going to keep moving just because we’re running out of time., John., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  You may not be willing to be specific about the matters that President Trump and President Macron will negotiate on, but the French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was very specific at the World Bank and IMF spring meeting.  He said on Friday, the French will insist on, and I quote, “a full and permanent exemption,” of any trade tariffs the United States might want to impose on France., He went on to say that if they are going to be a partner in dealing with China and other countries, they cannot have, what he called, a “sword of Damocles” hanging over them.  That’s pretty strong language.  Is trade and a permanent exemption —, SANDERS:  We can at least agree on that.  (Laughter.), Q    Is it on the table as Minister Le Maire wishes?, SANDERS:  Again, we certainly expect this to come up in conversations over the next two days.  When we have any policy announcements, we will absolutely let you know., Kevin., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Two quick ones.  One on Syria: Is it fair to say the President agrees with the French President that a precipitous or too-quick removal of America’s presence from Syria would be a danger or damaging to the Syrian people?  And if there is agreement there, is there a possibility that the two will come to some sort of a formal announcement during his time here?, And a follow on Mike Pompeo: What would be the number one issue that the President would like him to tackle assuming that, as expected, he is approved today?, SANDERS:  First, I’ll talk about the Syria question.  Again, certainly something that will come up.  The President is committed to defeating ISIS.  That is our primary goal and function and of being there.  We want to see that happen.  The President also wants to see the partners in the region step up and do more, both militarily and financially.  And that’s going to be something that I can imagine will be raised, and we’ll keep you posted on that front., When it comes to Director Pompeo, it is absolutely outrageous that he would not move through quickly.  He is extremely qualified for the positon.  The Washington Post, a number of other outlets that certainly aren’t typically the biggest advocates of this President, have said confirm him already., ...]

                                                                       \n",
       "318  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:59 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President will speaking at 2:30 on the administration’s efforts to reduce red tape and federal regulations.  Within 10 days of taking office, President Trump issued Executive Order 13771, instructing the Office of Management and Budget to remove two government regulations for every new one created.  Washington scoffed, but the administration acted.  And under a year, we have unleashed the American economy, businesses, and job creation., These efforts, and the rest of the President’s agenda, have fueled economic growth, including all-time highs in the stock market, a 17-year low in unemployment rolls, new highs in manufacturing and consumer confidence, and much more., As the President said yesterday, we’re at the final stages of historic tax cuts and reforms that will provide massive relief to middle-class families, lower tax rates on American businesses to make us more competitive, and make our tax code simpler and fairer for the first time in decades., We want to begin lowering the tax bills in Americans’ paychecks starting next year, where Americans who faced economic headwinds for eight years will have the wind at their backs as they seek the American Dream., And with that, we’ll get started because we are on a short timeframe.  And I will take your questions., Jonathan., Q    Sarah, on the taxes, what is the President’s message to those Americans, including some in the middle class, who will face tax increases under this tax bill?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, our focus since day one has been to aggressively push to make sure as many Americans as possible get a tax break, particularly those in the middle class.  That’s going to continue to be our focus as we continue in this process, as I’ve said time and time again., Q    But the message to those that will face an increase?  I mean, every analysis showed some people, including middle-class Americans, are going to face an increase., MS. SANDERS:  And, overwhelmingly, the middle class will get a huge tax break, as most Americans will.  And that is, again — our goal is to make sure that more Americans see more of their hard-earned money.  That’s what we’re pushing for and that’s what we’re going to keep working with the House and Senate to make sure happens., John., Q    On taxes, you got two “no’s” in the Senate so far.  You got Senator Corker who’s been a “no” for a while.  Senator Rubio came out and told us a short time ago that he’s a “no” unless he can get an expansion of the child tax credit.  Is the President willing to be a little more generous in the child tax credit in order to get Senator Rubio’s vote?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, we’re really proud of the work that we’ve done already up until this point, with Senator Rubio, already doubling the child tax credit, taking it to $2,000 per child.  We’re going to continue working with the senator.  But we think we’ve made great strides and, frankly, pretty historic movement in terms of the child tax credit.  And we’re very proud of that work.  We’re going to keep working with him until we get the job done, which we still expect to happen before the end of the year., Q    Is there more room to move?, MS. SANDERS:  Right now, we’re going to focus on letting some of the Senate move forward in the progression of their conversations.  Again, we’re extremely excited about the progress that we’ve already made to double the child tax credit.  I think that’s something important to note and something that we’ve worked very closely with Senator Rubio on.  And we think he should be very excited about the progress we’ve made on that front., Connie., Q    Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas., MS. SANDERS:  Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas to you, as well., Q    Thank you.  What have you learned this past year?  And what changes would you make in the coming year?, MS. SANDERS:  What have I learned this past year?  I would have to say that we would be here a really long time if I walked through everything I’ve learned this past year.  But some of my favorite things would probably be to take time to appreciate some of the really incredible moments and the special time and opportunity and honor that certainly I have, but I think that all of us have that we get to come to the White House every day, serve our country, and we get to call it work.  I think that’s pretty impressive, pretty amazing, and something that I hope none of us ever lose sight of., Thanks, Connie.  Mara., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Does the President think that Roy Moore should concede?  In other words, does he believe he lost the election fair and square, or does he think he was the victim of widespread illegitimate voting?, MS. SANDERS:  I think the President’s position is pretty clear.  In his outreach to Doug Jones directly, he called and they spoke yesterday.  They had a great conversation, a very positive conversation.  He likes Doug Jones and looks forward to meeting him in person, and hopes that he will come and follow through on his commitment to work with the President on some things that they agree on., Q    So Roy Moore lost fair and square.  That’s what you’re saying?, MS. SANDERS:  I think the numbers reflect that, and I think the President’s outreach shows that., Jordan., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  There’s some reports out this morning that Speaker Ryan is considering stepping down at the end of this Congress.  Has the President spoken to Speaker Ryan about those reports?  And does he want to see Speaker Ryan continue in that role?, MS. SANDERS:  The President did speak to the Speaker not too long ago and made sure that the Speake knew very clearly and in no uncertain terms that, if that news was true, he was very unhappy with it.  The Speaker assured the President that those were not accurate reports and that they look forward to working together for a long time to come., Blake., Q    So did this catch the President by surprise, the Ryan report that was out today?, MS. SANDERS:  It sounds like it may have caught Speaker Ryan by surprise — (laughter) — because I don’t think it was very accurate reporting.  And so it sounds like they’re both committed to and looking forward to spending a lot more time together over the next, hopefully, seven, eight years., Q    And let me ask you about Marco Rubio, as well.  We have heard folks who might be “no” votes, potentially undecided votes.  But Marco Rubio’s potential “no” vote is one that we know it concerns, but him voting no is seemingly here suddenly out of left field.  Has that caught the White House by surprise at all?  Or have you braced for the possibility that you might not have Marco Rubio in your corner?, MS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure if the President has spoken with him specifically today.  Again, we’re proud of the work that we’ve done with Senator Rubio, and we look forward to making sure that the progress that we made to double the childcare tax credit — that’s kind of a mouthful — goes into full effect when this piece of legislation is signed., April., Q    Sarah, two things.  Should Roy Moore just give his concession speech now, versus holding it out?, MS. SANDERS:  It probably sounds like it may have — should have already taken place.  Look, the President has already called and congratulated Doug Jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and to meet with him when he arrives in Washington., Q    And the second issue:  Did you watch GMA this morning?  And what are your thoughts about this tell-all and the un-comfortability of Omarosa while she was here with some issues?, MS. SANDERS:  I did see some clips of that.  In terms of a tell-all, that’s a question I think you would have to ask her.  She resigned from her position yesterday.  She’ll be here later this afternoon.  We put out a statement yesterday, and I don’t have any changes to add to that., And certainly, as has been the practice in the past and will continue to be in the future, we don’t comment much further than that on personnel matters., Jeff., Q    Sarah, if she’s resigned and she’s going to —, MS. SANDERS:  It’s confusing because you guys are sitting next to each other.  (Laughter.), Q    If she’s resigned, but you said she will stay on — Omarosa will stay on through January 20th — why are the taxpayers continuing to pay her salary for another month if she’s no longer here at the White House?, MS. SANDERS:  As I just said, I’m not going to weigh in any further, as we often do.  And as is the practice, we’re not going to get deeper into personnel matters.  We’ve put out a statement.  The President likes Omarosa, thanked her for her service.  And, again, she’ll be here later this afternoon, so she’s resigned from her position, but there’s really nothing else to add on that front., Q    If she has resigned, though, why is she still on the payroll for another month?  Is that normal?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, there’s a lot of different protocols that take place in the government.  That’s part of the process.  If you want to reach out to HR, they might be able to walk you through that in a more detailed way — certainly not that I’m privy to.  Thankfully, I haven’t been through the process myself, so I can’t speak to it from firsthand., Q    On a separate matter, on the tax plan, if I could just ask:  Will the President ask the House and Senate to stay here in Washington and finish this bill, even if it means bleeding into the Christmas holiday?, MS. SANDERS:  We’re pretty confident that we’re going to get there before then, but this is something that I think that both the House, the Senate, and the President are all committed to seeing happen.  And we’re very hopeful that it will take place at the first of next week., Jeff., Q    Sarah, does the President have any thoughts about the Disney deal to buy 21st Century Fox?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that the President spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal, and thinks that — to use one of the President’s favorite words — that this could be a great thing for jobs, and certainly looks forward to, and hoping to see a lot more of those created., Q    And what does the President think about the FCC decision on net neutrality?  There are a lot of Americans, polls show, who are very opposed to that change., MS. SANDERS:  Look, the Trump administration supports the FCC’s effort to roll back burdensome regulations.  But as we have always done and will continue to do, we certainly support a free and fair Internet.  Anything beyond that, I’d refer you to the FCC., Matthew., Q    Getting back to that Alabama result, does what happened down there change the President’s relationship at all with Steve Bannon, given his big support for Moore?  And has it changed the President’s thoughts on Moore — on, excuse me, Mr. Bannon’s opposition to other incumbent Republican senators?, MS. SANDERS:  That’s a question you’d have to ask Mr. Bannon.  I’m certainly not going to speak for him., Q    Well, I’m asking about the President’s relationship., MS. SANDERS:  I know, but the second part of the question you asked about whether or not he would support more candidates, and I can’t answer that., In terms of their relationship, I haven’t spoken with the President directly about the nature of that relationship and whether that has altered it., Francesca., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  I know that you said that you can’t go much further on this personnel matter, but I do want to try to separate out some of the things that we’re hearing here and just be crystal clear., So you’re saying that Omarosa Manigault was not fired on Tuesday evening, that she didn’t get belligerent in her conversation with General Kelly, she wasn’t yelling at him, she wasn’t cursing at him, and she wasn’t escorted off the property — and Secret Service has said not by them — but she wasn’t escorted off the property by someone or some entity other than Secret Service that evening?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, as I said, Omarosa resigned from her position.  I’m not going to go into a detailed process any further than that.  We’ve put out a statement, as is standard practice.  We’re not going to get into the weeds of a personnel decision here at the White House., Q    In an interview with STAT News this morning, Kellyanne Conway said she and other administration officials have been urging Congress to appropriate additional funding for the opioid epidemic.  The President declared a public health emergency earlier this fall, but that fund only has $57,000 in it.  Economists have predicted that it will cost upwards of $190 billion over a decade to treat the crisis.  Can you tell us how much money the White House will be urging Congress to appropriate?  And what do you have to say to critics who believe that the President hasn’t dedicated enough resources to combatting the epidemic this year?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, one of the reasons that the President has put one of his top people here at the White House, Kellyanne Conway, on this is because he sees this as a priority; he sees it as a major concern, not just for the White House, but certainly for America.  There’s a number of stories, as you just said.  The amount of money that it will take to combat this crisis is huge.  We’re going to continue looking at the best ways to do that.  We’re working in an interagency process to see what that number looks like.  That hasn’t been finalized, but we’re going to continue looking at every way possible —, Q    Is it more —, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t — right now, that’s still part of —, Q    Is it around $45 billion that was a part of the Republican healthcare plan?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, that’s, I think, a start.  But to fully address this, we want to make sure that we get it right and make sure that we really address this head on.  And that’s why the President has made it such a focus and put Kellyanne and others here at the White House to really make an emphasis and make that a priority., Q    Is that money something that you guys will get done — that appropriation — by the end of this year?  Can the President promise that?, MS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware that we can promise that a full funding for that would take place by the end of this year.  This wasn’t a problem that happened overnight.  We’re not going to be able to fix it overnight.  But what we want to do is make sure that we address it and that we make it a priority for the administration.  And we’re going to continue doing that until we beat it — the President has spoken about this several times — and making sure that we address it from all fronts and all sides., Kristen., Q    Sarah, thank you.  With Omarosa leaving, how many senior staffers here, at the White House, are African American?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, we have a really diverse team across the board at the White House.  We always want to continue to grow the diversity here.  We’re going to continue to do that and continue to work hard., Q    Do you have a number on how many are African American?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t have a number directly in front of me — specifically not African American.  But I can say, again, we have a very diverse team at the White House, certainly a very diverse team in the press office.  And something that we strive for every day is to add and grow, to be more diverse and more representative of the country at large, and we’re going to continue to do that., Q    She was really tasked with reaching out to the African American community.  Have you identified who is going to take that role?  And how critical is it to this President, to this administration, to make sure that that role is, in fact, filled?, MS. SANDERS:  Yeah, I think there are number of people that will be part of that process, and have been part of that process, that will continue to be.  This wasn’t something that was a singular effort by any one individual.  A member on the Cabinet, Ben Carson, I know has been engaged and talked with the President on this issue.  But it’s not just within the White House.  The President met with Senator Tim Scott.  I know he wants to continue those conversations as well, to look at the best ways to do that and to do outreach to that community., Q    And just to follow up one of April’s questions.  What Omarosa said today was, “I’ve seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people.”  Were her concerns ever addressed or dealt with?, MS. SANDERS:  The comments that she made, that was the first time I’d heard those.  Whether she raised them with other individuals, I’m not aware.  I know she regularly brought up specific issues where they were talked about in meetings, and we addressed them at the time., Q    Do you know if any of the issues or any of her concerns were?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t.  That’s a question that you would have to ask her, and I’m certainly not going to speak on her behalf in that regard.  But I do know that it’s something that we take seriously and something that we want to see improve, I think, across all fronts., Margaret. Q    Sarah, today is the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre in which so many children were killed.  That, of course, as a tragedy, was eclipsed by what happened in Las Vegas, which is now the most tragic mass shooting on U.S. soil., Since that time, what has President Trump done to try to protect the American people against a similar type of massacre?  Does he think anything has been done?  What is the administration trying to do?  Is there anything at the executive level that he thinks needs to be undertaken?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think that there are a number of different ways that we look to protect our citizens.  Every single day, one of the areas that the President has been outspoken about — not necessarily to those two instances — but just more broadly speaking in terms of national security and protecting individuals certainly through border security, stronger vetting processes, and looking at whether or not there are other regulations that we could put in place that would offer protection –Q    But these were domestic shooters.  These weren’t people who entered the United States., MS. SANDERS:  Right.  And I said I’m speaking more broadly in terms of national security as a whole.  And look, this is a President who knows that his number-one responsibility is to look for ways to protect American citizens.  And we try to do that every single day., And whether or not there’s a regulation that could have been put in place, or not, that could have prevented those things, frankly, I’m not aware of what that would be.  But we want to look for every opportunity, every way possible, that we can to protect American lives.  And we’re going to continue doing that., Q    So is it correct to say that the administration is looking at how to prevent these kind of mass shootings by domestic shooters on U.S. soil?  Or is it just the issue of immigrants and terrorism?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that’s something that — absolutely, I know that’s something that the Department of Homeland Security looks at and talks about and works on every single day.  I don’t think there’s a person in this country that wouldn’t like us to find ways to protect people, and we’re certainly very supportive of that.  And that’s something that would be —, Q    But no one issue that that the President has highlighted that says he wants to make a priority to push forward?, MS. SANDERS:  Well, I don’t think there’s any one thing that you could do that could have prevented either one of those instances — those horrible, horrible tragedies., Q    But there were prescriptions given very quickly just the other day for this failed terrorist attack, which is why in these cases — I mean, this is the worst shooting on U.S. soil on President Trump’s watch., MS. SANDERS:  I understand that.  And that’s why I also think that you have to take these matters, obviously, very seriously.  But if you could name a single thing that would have prevented both of these, I’d love to hear it, because I don’t know what that would look like.  But we’re looking every single day at how you can protect American lives, how we can best protect American citizens., In terms of New York, we know for a fact this individual came through a chain migration system.  This is something the President has been outspokenly against and something that he wants to stop.  And that individual wouldn’t have been here in order to commit that crime if that wasn’t in place.  So that’s a fact that we do know., Q    Does it involve a weapons ban, any kind of regulation, any kind of mental health concerns?  Has the President specifically mentioned that as a possibility?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that they’re looking at some of the mental health issues.  It’s something the President has raised before.  But in terms of a specific policy that we’re moving forward with that would have prevented that, I’m not aware of what that would be., Trey., Q    Thanks, Sarah.  Has the President expressed any concerns regarding the FCC’s decision today to roll back these Obama-era regulations on net neutrality?  And then, moving forward, are there any assurances that the White House can offer to the American people who are concerned that the decision and vote today will lead to a less-free Internet?, ...]

       "319  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 2:13 P.M. EST, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  This afternoon, the President is looking forward to officially announcing the new Chairman of his Board of Advisors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities., Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., who will be taking on this important role, is the former president of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and is currently CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management., As you all know, the President previously signed an executive order promoting excellence and innovation at HBCUs.  He believes this initiative will advance America’s full human potential.  And with today’s announcement, he continues to demonstrate his commitment to HBCUs., Before taking your questions today, I want to take a moment to highlight the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats — an issue that represents a threat to America’s interests and security., Compared to the four previous administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees.  Senator Schumer’s tactics have led to 73 fewer confirmations than the next closest administration.  Half of President Trump’s nominees are still waiting for confirmation in the Senate., The obstruction is so out of control, even some Senate Democrats believe it is inappropriate.  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said, “I don’t believe we should be holding nominees hostage…Enough is enough.  We need people who are qualified to fill these important positions in our government.”, In the coming days, we will be highlighting specific, qualified nominees who are, as the Senator said, being held hostage by Senator Schumer., Take, for instance, Ric Grenell, the President’s nominee to serve as Ambassador to Germany.  Mr. Grenell, a Harvard-educated, experienced diplomat, was the longest serving U.S. spokesperson at the United Nations.  He was nominated in September of last year.  He was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support.  He is waiting to represent America’s interests and be our country’s top voice in a G7 country., In short, Senator Schumer’s hyper-political delay on Mr. Grenell puts our national security, and America’s foreign policy interests, in jeopardy.  The Senate should move to confirm him immediately., We will continue highlighting more of these examples of Democrat obstruction in the days ahead., Finally, I’m sure — on a lighter note, I’m sure you all remember 11-year-old Natalie Dalton, who wrote in to the President, offering to cook for him.  We’re excited to announce today that Natalie, and her 8-year-old cousin Celia, will be coming to the White House on March 23rd to work with the White House kitchen staff.  We look forward to hosting them., And with that, I will take your questions.  Jonathan., Q    Sarah, Admiral Mike Rogers, the head of the NSA, said that he has not been granted any additional authority by the President to confront Russia — Russian cyber intrusion, interference with our election systems.  Why has he not been given that authority?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, just this week, they announced, through the State Department, that $40 million is being given to the Global Engagement Center to begin providing immediate support to private and public partners that expose and counter Russian and Chinese propaganda and disinformation.  We’re focused on looking at a variety of different ways.  As I told you last week, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, met with a number of both state, local, and federal officials working on ways that we can best prevent things like this in the future.  And we’re looking at a number of different options, and we’re going to continue doing that over the coming weeks., Q    But Admiral Rogers is the one that would have the agency that could actually go and confront Russian intrusion at the source.  And he hasn’t been given the authority.  In fact, he says that the Russians haven’t paid a sufficient price to make them change their behavior.  He’s the one with the power and with the means to do it.  All he needs is a presidential directive, the authority from the President to do it., MS. SANDERS:  I disagree with the premise of your question.  It’s not just one individual.  It’s looking at a number of different ways., Q    But why not give him the authority, though?  He’s in charge of Cyber Command.  Why not give him the authority?, MS. SANDERS:  Nobody is denying him the authority.  We’re looking at a number of different ways that we can put pressure.  Look, this President, as I told you last week, has been much tougher on Russia than his predecessor.  Let’s not forget that this happened under Obama.  It didn’t happen under President Trump.  If you want to blame somebody on past problems, then you need to look at the Obama administration., The President is looking at all of the different causes and all of the different ways that we can prevent it.  And as we find different ways that we can do that, we’re implementing them — like you see with the money that was allocated from the State Department, as you see with the conversations that the Secretary from DHS is having.  We’re going to continue looking at different ways to combat it, and I would imagine that that will be certainly a big part of it.  But I can’t speak to anything further on it right now., Q    This is not about the past, though.  This is not about the past.  This is about protecting intrusion in the next election., MS. SANDERS:  Exactly.  And that’s —, Q    And he said that he needs the authority, and he hasn’t been given it.  He says he can’t act without the authority., MS. SANDERS:  Well, I can’t speak to that specifically.  I can tell you that we are taking a number of steps to prevent this, and we’re looking at a variety of other ways that we’re going to continue to implement over the coming weeks and months., Justin., Q    I have one on the renewable fuel credit.  But first, just a housekeeping one on the clearances.  The Oversight Committee requested details from the White House about still-pending clearances among White House staff, and whether there is any derogatory information there.  They set a deadline of tomorrow.  The Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter over today asking for some of the same information.  I’m wondering if the White House is going to — plans to comply with those requests.  And if — I know you’ve been hesitant to release some of that information, even in aggregate —, MS. SANDERS:  I haven’t been hesitant.  I’ve been very clear that we don’t discuss security clearances.  And that’s not changing today, it didn’t change yesterday.  It’s not going to change tomorrow., Q    So you don’t plan to comply with the request from (inaudible)?, MS. SANDERS:  I didn’t say that.  I said I’m not going to discuss security clearances with members of the press.  And that hasn’t been different at any point during this administration, and we have no intention of changing it right now., Q    When are you going to comply with those tomorrow?, MS. SANDERS:  I’ll let you know when we have a chance to review that and make a decision., Q    But — can I do the fuel standard question?, MS. SANDERS:  Sorry, go ahead., Q    Yeah.  You guys put out a statement today saying that the President supports the renewable fuel credit, but also that he is in support of energy producers.  So it seems that the issue here is whether or not the President or the White House supports a cap to lower the cost of credit waivers.  So I’m wondering if you could tell us what the President’s position is on that., MS. SANDERS:  Look, the President knows that there are a lot of differing views on this issue.  We’re going to continue having conversations.  He met, today, with Senator Cruz, Ernst, Grassley, and Toomey to discuss this and to continue that conversation.  They had a productive meeting, and we’re going to continue working with not only those members but others as we go through this process., John., Q    Two questions, different topics.  If I could return to something that we talked about yesterday: the President’s support to raise the minimum age of buying a long gun from 18 to 21.  He expressed support for that idea in a tweet last Thursday.  He talked about it with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas.  He didn’t mention it at CPAC.  He didn’t mention with the governors.  He said he had lunch with Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox —, MS. SANDERS:  To be fair, of all of the governors, when that conversation was opened, none of them mentioned it either.  But — in a two-hour discussion., Q    But he had supported it, so.  He had lunch with Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox.  The NRA remains firmly opposed to this idea of raising the age for long guns.  The President said yesterday, if they’re not always with you, sometimes you got to fight them.  Is he willing to take on the NRA on this idea of raising the minimum age for buying long guns?, MS. SANDERS: The President still supports raising the age limit to 21 for the purchase of certain firearms.  We’re meeting with bipartisan members of Congress tomorrow.  We expect that to be a topic of discussion.  He knows that everybody doesn’t necessarily agree.  We’re not going to get into the details on the specifics of what we will propose, but we expect that to be part of the conversation tomorrow., Q    Question number two on an unrelated topic.  Jeff Sessions confirmed, a few minutes ago, that he is going to open an investigation into FISA abuses during the election.  The President clearly has been expressing that he believes that Sessions should look into this.  Is the President happy now that Sessions is opening this investigation?, MS. SANDERS:  I haven’t spoken with him about it to determine his feelings.  But as you said, it’s something that he’s clearly had frustration over, so I would imagine he certainly supports the decision to look into what we feel to be some wrongdoing.  I think that’s the role of the Department of Justice, and we’re glad that they’re fulfilling that job., Margaret., Q    Sarah, I have one question.  But one housekeeping item before that.  You talked about nominations and how slow Congress is to move.  I’m wondering, do you have a timeline on when the White House will name a nominee to be ambassador to South Korea?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t have a timeline, and I don’t have any personnel announcements on that position, specifically., Q    Okay.  And then the question I had, again, going back to Admiral Rogers.  He said today, we are not where we need to be or want to be on cyber.  Does the White House, does the President plan to hold a National Security Council session to discuss, specifically, these concerns about having a menu of options to respond to a cyberattack, and one specifically in relation to Russia?, MS. SANDERS:  In terms of a specific meeting, I don’t know that a date is set.  But I do know that there are constantly conversations going on within the administration on this topic.  And we’re going to continue those, and I’ll keep you posted on the President’s schedule., Q    Has there been one so far on Russia and cyberattacks?, MS. SANDERS:  I know that he’s been briefed on it.  In terms of specifics beyond that, I’d have to check and get back to you., Jordan., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Did anyone from the White House instruct Hope Hicks not to answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee about her time serving in the White House and in the transition?, MS. SANDERS:  As is always the case, I’m not going to comment on any individual’s interactions with the Committee.  But we are cooperating because, as the President has said repeatedly, there is no collusion.  And we’re going to continue to cooperate.  Hopefully they’ll wrap this up soon., Q    Why did she refuse to answer the questions about —, MS. SANDERS:  Again, I’m not going to comment on any individual’s specific interactions with the committee.  I’d refer you to outside attorneys for that., Jon., Q    Thanks a lot, Sarah.  I just want to pick up on what Jordan was just asking you, and that is about this idea of citing executive privilege for conversations that took place during the transition period.  We’re told that’s exactly what Hope Hicks, the Communications Director, cited in refusing to answer questions that were posed of her related to the transition period.  Is the President aware, is the White House aware that no federal court, at any level, has ever granted that privilege pertaining to the transition period?, MS. SANDERS:  Just because we ask the question in different ways, I’m still not going to comment on any individual’s interactions with the committee.  I’m also not going to comment on leaks from what is supposed to be a confidential setting.  There continues to be zero evidence of collusion, and we hope these investigations wrap up shortly., Steve., Q    To follow up on what Margaret was asking.  Joseph Yun, the State Department’s envoy to North Korea, is retiring.  How does that impact the diplomatic process?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, we’re going to continue appointing people to different positions, whether it’s the Ambassador to South Korea and a number of other positions.  I don’t have any specific announcements on it at this time., Q    And secondly, the Chinese economic minister is here for trade talks.  As you consider tariffs on steel and aluminum, what do you hope to hear from this fella?, MS. SANDERS:  He’s meeting with a few different members of the administration, but not the President directly.  I don’t have any specific readouts from any of his meetings at this point., Q    Thank you very much.  House Speaker Ryan, today, disagreed with the President on arming teachers.  He says he thinks it should be up to the locals whether teachers should be armed.  What is the President’s response to not having support from the Republican leader of the House?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, as we’ve said, this is something that will continue to be part of the discussion with state, federal, and local officials as well as law enforcement.  The President is going to be meeting with bipartisan lawmakers tomorrow, and that will be another one of those topics discussed, and we’ll have further specific policy announcements later this week., Q    But without the support of Speaker Ryan, how can this get any traction in the House?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, this is part of an ongoing conversation.  It’s something that the President still supports.  It’s something he knows that there are a lot of differing views on.  It’s one of the topics that we expect to come up tomorrow and we’re going to continue having that discussion., I think the number-one thing that we’re looking at is, every possible action that we can take that helps protect the safety and security of the schoolkids across this country, we’re going to look at everything we can.  A lot of those things that you guys have brought up today will be part of the discussion tomorrow.  And we expect to have some specific policy proposals later this week., Steve., Q    Yes, Sarah.  Today, the White House announced that it’s cutting about $8 million in aid to Cambodia for what it calls, “Recent setbacks in democracy there.”  Can you talk a little bit about what went into this decision, and why, specifically, just Cambodia, and not other countries where there have also been recent setbacks to democracy, such as neighboring Thailand?, MS. SANDERS:  The elections that happened earlier this month failed to represent the genuine will of the Cambodian people.  That gave us great cause for concern.  These setbacks compelled the United States to review that assistance.  Based on the review, the government will suspend or curtail several assistance programs intended to support the Cambodian government.  I don’t have anything further at this point., Anita., Q    Two questions on two different topics.  First, does President Trump believe that the governor of Missouri — who, as you know, has been indicted — should resign?, MS. SANDERS:  I haven’t spoken with him about that., Q    Okay can you go back to —, MS. SANDERS:  But my guess is that he would refer to the people of the state of Missouri, but I haven’t spoken directly with him, so I would have to get back to you., Q    The President is the leader of the Republican Party, and obviously the governors —, MS. SANDERS:  I’m well aware., Q    Well, I mean, he’s a Republican —, MS. SANDERS:  Anita, I haven’t spoken with him.  I’d have to ask him., Q    Can you get back to me on that?, MS. SANDERS:  Sure., Q    Okay.  Second question.  The President is having several meetings, as you mentioned, with lawmakers of both parties this week on other topics.  Is he going to be talking to them about immigration?  His deadline that he set, March 5th, is next Monday.  Congress is nowhere near doing anything about that.  Is that still the deadline?  Is he encouraging them to get something done?, MS. SANDERS:  Absolutely, he’s encouraging them to get something done.  That’s why he laid out exactly what he expected to see in a proposal that would not only help solve the DACA problem, but also provide border security.  The President went above and beyond what previous administrations have done and offered on that program., It’s really sad that Democrats are not willing to come to the table, get something done, and actually fix problems and do their job.  But the President is still hopeful, and we’re going to continue pushing forward and hope we get something done., Q    So, on Monday — what’s going to happen on Monday when the deadline comes?, MS. SANDERS:  Again, we’re still hopeful that something happens on this and that Congress will actually do its job., Olivier., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  I’ve got a couple for you as well.  One on North Korea.  Joseph Yun, who’s been the point person for North Korea policy, has announced he’s leaving.  Does the President plan to replace him?, MS. SANDERS:  I don’t have any personnel announcements at this time., Q    And then on the — we’re heading into the midterm election year, obviously.  Have White House staff been briefed on the dos and don’ts of political activity, including the prohibition on using formal titles in campaign literature?, MS. SANDERS:  I know for sure that Cabinet and senior staff have been, and I believe a paper memo was distributed to all staff, but I’d have to verify that to be sure.  But I know that both Cabinet and senior staff have been briefed on upcoming midterm elections and what they are allowed to do and not do., Mara., Q    Thank you, Sarah.  Does the President believe someone who’s on the no-fly list because of suspected terrorist activity should be able to buy a gun?, MS. SANDERS:  We haven’t spoken about that specifically and don’t have any policy announcement on that front., Q    I don’t want a policy announcement.  I just want to know if he thinks that somebody —, MS. SANDERS:  Well, that would be a policy.  Whether or not the President supports something or not would be a policy., Q    So he doesn’t know?, MS. SANDERS:  I said we haven’t — I haven’t spoken with him about it, so I’d have to get back to you., John., ...]

       "320  [James S. Brady Briefing Room, 1:41 P.M. EDT, MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First, at the top, I wanted to note that the President has been briefed on the situation in London. He just spoke to Prime Minister May, and we’ll have a readout on that situation and that call soon., We obviously condemn today’s attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism. And we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation. The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers., The City of London and Her Majesty’s government have the, \\nfull support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible. We will provide you with further updates as warranted and, as I mentioned, a readout of the President’s call with the Prime Minister., Turning to the events of today — this morning, the President received his daily intelligence briefing. He stopped by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems Administrator, Seema Verma. And also, that event was attended by the Vice President and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price., Healthcare professionals have seen the challenges of implementing Obamacare firsthand. They’re a valuable asset to the President and his team as we continue to consider and enact policies, like the American Health Care Act, that will make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone., The women who were at the roundtable today represent the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and administrators who make sure that people around the country receive the necessary preventative and lifesaving care that they need every day., \\nThe doctors who attend to the patients in the family practices, emergency rooms, and clinics — and those who support them on the administrative and technical sides — are one of our country’s most treasured resources., With the passage of the American Health Care Act and the rest of the President’s healthcare reform agenda, everyone, regardless of their financial situation, will be able to take full advantage of this resource., That’s why, at last count, over 40 major associations have expressed their support for the American Health Care Act, with several of them, including the U.S. Chamber [of Commerce], the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and, just today, the National Taxpayers Union calling it a key vote., Following his appearance at the panel, the President and his legislative affairs team hosted several members of the House of Representatives for another meeting on the American Health Care Act. The President acknowledged, as he has before, that the AHCA is only one step in the larger process of fixing the broken healthcare system created by Obamacare, but it’s an essential first step., Undoing and fixing all of the misguided policies is going to require a holistic, multistep process. And that’s why the President and his team are fully committed to maintaining an open line of communication with Capitol Hill leadership throughout this entire process., Throughout the weeks since the AHCA was first introduced, they have been meeting with Republican members from across the political spectrum, many of whom we’ve seen move from “no” to “yes,” as they learn more about the legislation and amendments that have been adopted. Continued coordination between administrative and legislative actions will ensure that our new healthcare system is effective and efficient., This afternoon, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus’s Executive Committee. The President has brought in and will continue to hear from representatives of all interests as he continues to note that he is the President of all Americans. Diversity makes our nation strong, and it also means that we don’t necessarily agree on every policy item but that we continue to have a dialogue towards productive policies that help America move forward., The President looks forward to discussing the CBC’s policy priorities and finding ways that they can work together where those priorities align., This evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary, \\nof State Tillerson. Today at the State Department, Secretary Tillerson hosted the foreign ministers and senior leaders of the Global Coalition working to defeat ISIS for the first meeting of the full coalition of 68 members since December 2014. This meeting follows up on the defense ministerial Secretary Mattis hosted last month in Brussels., The coalition is united in the fight against ISIS, and this meeting seeks to accelerate international efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it holds in Iraq and Syria, while maximizing pressure on its branches, affiliates, and networks., \\nThis meeting is a part of our whole-of-government approach to defeating ISIS. The Trump administration will use all of the tools of national power, in coordination with our international powers [partners], to cut off ISIS’s funding, expand intelligence sharing, and deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens., Also today, over on the Hill, Judge Gorsuch [is] in his second day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his nearly 12 hours of questioning yesterday — now at least I know how someone else feels — (laughter) — the judge continued to prove himself an enormously qualified jurist that Americans will all be proud to see on the Supreme Court. It’s not surprising that Senate Democrats are failing to gain traction for any of their potshots and opposition to Judge Gorsuch. There’s simply not enough politicizing the Senate Democrats can do to hide the fact that Judge Gorsuch is an immensely qualified and thoughtful jurist with a lifelong dedication to our Constitution., A few administrative notes here before I take your questions: Last night, we formally announced that the President will travel to Brussels for the May 25th meeting of NATO heads of state and government. During this meeting, the President looks forward to reaffirming our strong commitment to NATO and discussing critical issues to the Alliance, especially Allied responsibility-sharing and NATO’s role against — the fight against terrorism., The President will also host NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to the White House on April 12th., Today, the President declared a major disaster exists in the state of Wyoming and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in February., We also announced that the President will deliver this year’s commencement address at Liberty University on May 13th., \\nThe President is proud to call Liberty’s president, Jerry Falwell, his wife Becki and their entire family, his friends, and looks forward to celebrating the success of this amazing graduating class on such a momentous occasion., Finally, a few minutes ago, many of you may have seen that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, gave remarks on the surveillance collected on individuals associated with the President. Let me quote him directly:, \\n“I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in the intelligence community reporting. And third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or [of] the Trump team.”, My understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming to the White House later to brief the President on this development, and we will have a readout for that meeting once it occurs., With that, I’ll be glad to take your questions. Mara., Q Two questions. One on Nunes and then healthcare. Is your understanding that this — none of these unmasked names were leaked?, MR. SPICER: I don’t know. I literally read the statement — or heard the statement, came out and briefed it. It was wrapping up as we were beginning this., Q Okay. Today in the pool spray, the President said “keep your doctor, keep your plan” didn’t work out that way. You didn’t get your doctor. You don’t get your plan. This is one of the reasons we have to repeal Obamacare., Is the President assuring people who currently like their plan or like their doctor that under the American Health Care Act they can keep their doctor and their plan?, MR. SPICER: Well, that’s the hope. And what I mean by that is not to be cute, but last time they were promised something that didn’t turn out. I can’t promise something that a doctor stays in a plan or a plan stays there. But that’s a bit different., We understand that we’re letting market forces come into play here. Competition. Doctors can change what insurances they take. Plans can come in and out of markets., What I think we can be assured of is a couple of things. One is that currently under Obamacare, premiums are set to continue to skyrocket. We’ve seen an average of 25 percent. We’ve noted before in Arizona, they’ve gone up 116 percent. I think there’s no question that the additional competition and amendments that have been brought into this discussion will help lower the trajectory of that, number one., Number two is I think that they’re going to see greater choice. So I think those are the things that we’re willing to talk about being part of this plan because you can’t — where they erred last time is went out and made promises that they couldn’t keep. And I think that one of the problems that they did is that they’ve tried to suppress market forces and competition. And instead of lowering costs and increasing choice, which is what they sought to do, it did the opposite. So that’s where this is headed, and I think that’s important., John., Q Thanks a lot, Sean. On the AHCA, Mark Meadows, who appears to be a firm no in terms of his opposition to the replacement bill, said that 25 members of the Freedom Caucus are opposed to this replacement bill. Do you dispute those numbers?, MR. SPICER: I’m not going to share our whip count. I know we saw Lou Barletta, who was a hard no, come out and say he’s yes. Steve King I believe had been a no; he’s a yes. Member by member we’re seeing tremendous support flow in our direction, and the count keeps getting stronger for us. So I’m not going to start to get into yes or nos. But I would just say that former Congressman Mulvaney, now Director of OMB Mulvaney, who is a leader in that caucus, has been a very strong advocate of this policy. As you know, he’s been up on the Hill talking to his former colleagues, assuring them of the effort and why the process has to go the way it does., But I’m optimistic in the sense of what we’re seeing and the trajectory that this is going, and the number of votes that are flowing our way, not the other way., Q And on the confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch, I have not seen any Democrat come out in support of Judge Gorsuch just yet. Do you anticipate that you’ll get Democratic support on this particular nomination?, MR. SPICER: I hope and believe so. I think that there have been several that have been spoken very positively. I think he’s been extremely impressive throughout this confirmation process, and you’ve heard members both in the Senate, on the committee, and then a lot of outside voices comment on how well he’s done, how qualified he is. And I think it’s tough for anybody to say that he’s not immensely qualified for this position., Alexis., Q Sean, related to Congressman Nunes, can you explain why the White House has agreed to meet with him at all about what his findings are? And the reason I ask that is because the minute that Director Comey said that there was an official investigate, it might appear as if the White House is interfering with the investigation. And Congressman Nunes should present his information not to the White House but to the FBI. So why is anyone here at the White House agreeing to meet with him about his findings?, MR. SPICER: We’ll have a readout for you after that meeting. I think he did this press conference. He made the announcement that he was coming up to see the President to share these findings. I don’t know who else he’s shared them with. I don’t know — to your question, I don’t know if he’s briefed anyone else on it in terms of the intelligence community — either Admiral Rogers or Comey — of whether this is something they shared with him., But I think after the meeting, hopefully depending on the classification level, we may be able to share more on that with you., Q Can I just add, is the President concerned at all that there will be an appearance immediately, today that he has interfered with an ongoing investigation — whether it’s a congressional investigation or the executive branch investigation by meeting privately with a congressman who says he has information?, MR. SPICER: So let me get this straight. Number one, we asked — as you know, two weeks ago, we said this was the appropriate venue., Number two, you guys have asked us over and over again, why aren’t we meeting with certain individuals. The chairman of the committee that — one of the two committees that we asked to look into this — wants to share his findings, or what he knows. I think that is exactly how we’ve talked about this working. But I would leave it to Congressman Nunes to come up, and to brief and share his thoughts. I don’t know what his plan is. Obviously, he sat — he briefed the media before he briefed us. He went down and talked about what he had found., So, you know, it’s interesting, I didn’t see any complaints from you guys when he went down and held a press conference for the umpteenth time talking about his findings and what he’s found. There is no complaints from the media when he shares what he has found with you guys. But when he wants to come up here and tell us, this is where the investigation stands and here’s what I’ve unloaded — or excuse me, learned — there’s seems to be a little bit of an interesting double standard on that., Q Just to close the loop, because the President said that he had additional information that he believed the White House or he or his representatives would present, related to this investigation, what Congressman Nunes has is not related to that?, MR. SPICER: I don’t — you’re asking me questions that — he has not briefed us. He has not briefed the President. You guys, as I noted — he actually went down and spoke to the media before he shared this with us., So I would ask the colleagues that of yours that ask questions, more than you have — you’ve had — collectively, the media has more of an opportunity to ask questions and to hear what he has to say than we do at this point. So once we have more to understand what he said, to the extent that we can, I’m sure we’ll be glad to share it with you. But the media has more information than we do at this point., Jon., Q Sean, staying on that, didn’t we already know that there was incidental collection of intelligence involving some members of the transition team? And I point to —, MR. SPICER: Not the way you guys ask the questions. I mean, you questioned us every day about what we knew, and now you’re coming back to me saying, didn’t we already know this. Well — I’m doing somewhat of an effective job., Q No, but didn’t we already know that Flynn was monitored in his conversations with Kislyak?, MR. SPICER: Right., Q So we know —, MR. SPICER: Again, I guess my point, John, is I don’t know. He made a statement, went down to the press. Until we get briefed on this, until the President gets briefed, I don’t know what he knows. And so to ask — until that occurs, and until we have the ability to share some of that in an unclassified nature, I don’t want to get ahead of it. I don’t know what he knows. That’s why, apparently, he’s coming up to share his findings with the President. At least that’s what he said. Again, let’s wait and see how this unfolds., Q And on the American Health Care Act, Mark Meadows says they don’t have the votes, they need to start over and do a new bill. That sounds like you’re in pretty serious trouble., MR. SPICER: No, that sounds like one member’s opinion. As I mentioned —, Q Who represents a large contingent of people who oppose the bill., MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but again, I just named a few of the members that are part of that caucus that have come on board. I think that — look, every day, you see more and more of those members from that caucus and throughout the entire conference express their support for the bill. The President was up yesterday for a while talking to them., We’ve had members — and the Vice President has been actively engaged — Mick Mulvaney, Reince Priebus, Marc Short and Rick Dearborn, who lead our leg affairs team. These guys have been flooding the Hill. They’ve been on the phone, having meetings with them. There’s been a series of members up here all day. I think the trajectory is going very well for us., Q And Heritage Action says you can easily fix this bill simply by removing the regulatory framework — the tax credits and all of that — and you’ll get massive buy-in from conservatives. But can you do that?, MR. SPICER: There are certain constraints that we have in the reconciliation process. And for those who are steeped in the arcane rules of the Senate, there’s a thing called the Byrd Rule, and it does not allow policy to be recreated. It has to do with the budgetary nature of that vehicle to get — that’s sustainable at 50 votes. Right now, there are certain things that I think a lot of people would like but that will not potentially get ruled in order by the Senate parliamentarian., So I understand what people want, but I think that we have created a vehicle to get this done. This is the only way that we will repeal and replace Obamacare. And again, I think people have to recognize that there is a three-step process to doing this. This is exactly how the Democrats enacted it, and this is exactly how we will unwind it and implement a much better system. That’s it, plain and simple., Margaret., Q Sean, I know you can’t get ahead of Nunes, but what he said was, incidental, legal surveillance using a FISA warrant, which would —, MR. SPICER: I don’t believe he said FISA warrant., Q He did., MR. SPICER: Did he? Okay., Q He did. And that’s why I’m asking this question, which is, does the Trump administration have the presumption that foreign leaders or foreign nationals will not be surveilled when they are in contact with —, MR. SPICER: No, look, again, as I said, I don’t want to start talking or guessing what he may say or may not say, or explain this. I think that we will have more information, or I hope to have more information once the President is briefed, and to find out what else has gone on in terms of additional information on this. But I do think it is a startling revelation and there’s a lot of questions that need to get asked. I think it’s interesting all of the questions are in the presumptive negative towards us, as opposed to “why was this taking place, why were people surveilled ostensibly; they were involved in the campaign.” Because it’s not —, Q Well, that’s why I’m trying to clarify that —, MR. SPICER: No, no, the question is — the question —, Q — was your presumption that foreign nationals —, MR. SPICER: No, no, it’s not a presumption. Actually, I’m not the one —, Q (Inaudible.), MR. SPICER: Right. Respectfully, I’m not the one with the presumption — you guys are. I didn’t come up here presuming anything. I actually started my comments off by saying that —, Q Well, I would presume that foreign nationals are being monitored by U.S. intelligence when they are talking to anyone., MR. SPICER: And then the question — I think there’s a series of questions, which is, how many times was an individual picked up? Why were they picked up? Were they unmasked? Again, a lot of this, if they’re picked up during a FISA warrant, is that American citizens are prohibited by law from being unmasked, from “having their name put out there.” Why would someone’s name get put out there? What ways were they described? There’s a lot of questions that need to get asked. Those are the relevant issues that need to get asked. How many times was one individual followed? Did their name get unmasked, and why? But there’s a lot of things that need to get followed up on. We’re not at that position yet, as I’ve said now multiple times. The Chairman is going to come up here, brief the President, I don’t know to what extent and to what detail. But hopefully, as we move forward, we will have more., Q Is this what you’ve been — because you’ve said there’s more information to come, more information to come. Is this what you’ve been gesturing towards?, MR. SPICER: I don’t know. For the eighth time, there is no — we don’t know what he’s going to come up here and explain and share. And until that happens, for me to talk about where we think this is headed — again, we’re not in the business of trying to get to this point yet. We say, this is what they have. We’ve asked that the investigation be conducted and that people gather up information. What they have and to what extent, we’ll know soon., April., Q Sean, I have a series of questions on a topic. Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, met with an official here at the White House yesterday. She’s looking for fairness and justice in her son’s case. What should we expect to come out of that meeting with this White House official? Should there be a push to make sure that there is an indictment of the police officer’s —, MR. SPICER: I mean, that’s a Department of Justice question. For us to get involved in a case, a specific case, would be highly inappropriate in terms of trying to guess what the outcome of a case should be., Q Well, along that line, the official, according to Ms. Carr, reached out to the Department of Justice, the civil rights division, had the wrong number; called another department, had the right number. Now, in previous administrations, to include the Obama administration and other administrations, the Department of Justice had limited the numbers of people to call over to the Department of Justice. Has the Attorney General, this Attorney General Sessions, changed that memo? What has he done?, MR. SPICER: Well, it would have to be reissued. That’s a separate issue in terms of — every Attorney General issues a memo going back to, I think, Mukasey was the first one — post-Watergate — I’m trying to remember who issued the first one. But it has been a practice of I think almost every Attorney General to issue a memo spelling out the procedures that officials in the Justice Department contact the White House and who they can contact, and the nature of which and what their exceptions are, et cetera. Those memos get crafted by each administration, by each new Attorney General., I would refer you back to the Department of Justice on the status of that under this Attorney General., Q So how many officials here have that right, to call the Department of Justice, even if it’s for —, MR. SPICER: I don’t know the answer. I would refer you to the Department of Justice., Q But was there wrongdoing in this effort to call over to the Department of Justice?, MR. SPICER: I don’t know. I don’t know the nature of — I’ll have to look into what you’re asking. But I would, again, refer you back to the Department of Justice., Hunter., Q Yes. Thank you, Sean. I have two quick questions. Last November, President Trump dismissed reports he was trying to obtain security clearances for his children as “a typically false news story.” Now there are reports Ivanka Trump is indeed attempting to obtain a clearance.

       "321  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:48 P.M. EDT, MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President is constantly monitoring Hurricane Irma, and the federal government is working closely with our state and local partners to ensure the safety of the coastal communities., In his Weekly Address to the nation this morning, the President noted that this is a storm of historic destructive potential, and he’s asking that everyone in the storm’s path remain vigilant and heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement., Our message to the American people is this:  With gratitude for our first responders, and prayers for those in the storm’s path, we are behind you 100 percent., With that, I’d like to bring up the President’s Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, to discuss specifics on the federal government’s ongoing preparedness and response efforts., And after, I’ll be up to take further questions.  Thanks., MR. BOSSERT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Thanks to each of you for being here.  I can’t add too much more to that, so let me see if I can just jump in a little bit to my thinking here.  As you’ve heard me say before, I like to try to categorize my thoughts into informing, influencing, and inspiring, if I can., In terms of informing, please recall the process here is that the federal government, under President Trump’s leadership and the leadership of his Cabinet, is fully engaged, but they’re fully engaged in support of the governors.  Those governors at this point are engaged in various different forms and phases of what we consider incident management., So as I walk through Irma, let me stop — I’d be remiss if I didn’t — and talk about Texas and Harvey., So, Governor Abbott and I have been in close contact and haven’t stopped that contact, because his people in Texas and the people of Louisiana, under Governor Edwards, are involved in the early stages of what will be a long recovery effort., The people in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the other Caribbean islands affected by Harvey [Irma] already are in the middle of acute lifesaving and life-sustaining response operations., And what we’re seeing in Florida and South Carolina and Georgia are the final stages of preparation for the beginning of response operations., So we’re seeing all three play out for us at the same time.  It requires us to juggle some of our thinking, but it doesn’t require us to juggle our resources., So, to be clear, the response operations have ceased lifesaving and life-sustaining in Harvey, and we had an opportunity to rest and refit our forces, move them out, and reposition them for Harvey [Irma].  We’re right now employing them in the islands to save lives, and we will maintain a good footprint and posture to do the same in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia as the storm progresses., So I’ll come back to some of the path and the track and forecast here in a moment.  I’d like to see if I could reinforce that by suggesting we take this very seriously.  It’s not only a dangerous storm; we’ve already seen loss of life.  This storm has taken lives already.  It’s going to take more, unfortunately, if we’re not prepared.  So please take it seriously., I’d also suggest now, in terms of influencing, that people stop watching so carefully this track, and start thinking a little bit more seriously about getting themselves into a safe place and out of danger.  Now, I don’t want them to take that as a call for shadow evacuations.  Please listen to your local authorities on evacuation orders.  They’re not only looking out for your best interest, but they’re carefully coordinating.  This is a peninsula, and so people need to evacuate from south to north, and that is a staggered and carefully thought-through process., But what I am suggesting is, at this point this is a large storm.  And whether it wobbles left or wobbles right, you need to at this point start thinking through your own personal accountability.  So please make sure — it’s kind of an oxygen mask theory — take care of yourself first so you can take care of others, take care of your loved ones.  And if you’re able, please take care of strangers and others in need.  I think that’s something that we’ve seen in Texas and I have every reason to believe that the people of Florida and South Carolina will show that same American spirit and value., Lastly, if I can, there’s been a lot of kind of coverage of Florida but not necessarily media coverage of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  And if I can, I’ll give you a brief update on where we stand there., We are, as I just talked to Department of State and Department of Defense officials, engaging in this lifesaving, life-sustaining operation in the following way:  Governor Mapp is experiencing loss of power; loss of water, as a result; loss of communications; and some other sheltering needs.  And so what we’re doing is sending in air operations and surface operations to evacuate citizens.  We’re also doing that in St. Martin and St. Maarten, the Dutch-French island that’s been reported there are some American citizens there., We are currently in the final stages of operations planning to evacuate those citizens.  There are numbers ranging from 350 to 6,000.  That was our planning assumption parameter.  Those American citizens will be removed via surface and air means.  We’ve had to do some kind of planning adjustment for surf conditions for wind and for Hurricane Jose as we look forward to that hopefully missing the United States.  It’s unfortunately still causing some havoc in the islands, in our response operations, our evacuation operations., So that’s where we stand on that.  They’ll begin executing those plans, if not already, at some point soon today.  And we’ll see some of those American citizens and other evacuated as necessary, to include anyone with critical or acute medical needs., So that’s where I would stop on the update, and I’ll take your questions., Q    Tom, one of the big problems with the Florida evacuation is that so many gas stations are running out of gasoline.  What, if anything, can the federal government do in the next 24 hours to assist in getting more fuel to the people in Florida?, MR. BOSSERT:  So there’s a number of things that we’ve done.  I should stop and mention by name, Governor Scott — tremendous leadership, tremendous confidence.  He and the President have spoken, and I have spoken.  I’ve got every confidence in the governor and his emergency manager.  They’re demonstrating the same leadership resolve and skill and quality of effort that we saw in Texas a week ago., What we’re seeing in Florida, though, are fuel shortages.  We saw those same fuel shortages in Texas because people appropriately gas up their generators, their cars, their boats and so forth., So what we’ll see here now is a need to pull in additional fuel, and that need will run up against the onset of tropical storm force winds., So what are we doing?  We’re bringing in as much supply of refined fuel as possible, and we’ve waived a particular statute that allows for foreign flag vessels to help in that effort.  So it’s little technical, but it’s called the Jones Act.  Some of you have reported on it.  What happens is the Secretary of Homeland Security can waive that act.  Until that’s waived, only U.S. flag vessels can move fuel from point to point, domestically., What we’ve done now is we’ve freed up that prohibition, so now foreign flag vessels — so as many ships, tanker ships as possible are now being brought to bear on the effort to bring as much fuel as possible and to help Floridians, regardless of their flag vessel status.  And that’s the best we can do.  In addition, they’re planning all the intermodal points to get trucks from those tanker ship port locations into the gas stations.  So that’s what we’re doing., Q    The window is rapidly closing.  How much more can you get in there?, MR. BOSSERT:  The conditions will dictate that.  I don’t think there will be too much more that we can get in.  At some point here they’ll have to stop those operations.  And again, that’s one of my messages here.  It’s not a tough love message, it’s just a message of clarity and honesty., At some point, people are going to be on their own, so to speak, for a period of time during which the flooding, the raining, and the wind bear down on them, and they need to be prepared if they are in that path and haven’t taken some action to get themselves in a less dangerous position, to be ready for at least a 72-hour period.  That would be my advice for them to have enough food, water, and shelter before the government can get back in., We have pre-deployed and pre-staged, but we can’t actually get to that final point of care until conditions permit., Q    One housekeeping question.  For FEMA to have resources and no broken chain there, the President needs to sign legislation the House just passed this morning.  Any indication of when that’s going to happen?, MR. BOSSERT:  So I’d like to start by thanking Congress.  They came in in a fast way to give us the emergency supplemental funding.  I think that’s what you’re alluding to., First, FEMA still has the money that they need, so there’s no break in operations — I want to make sure to clarify on your question there — but there will be a break in their operations if they run out of money.  That’s why that supplemental legislation was so necessary.  Thank you to the House and Senate leadership for bringing everyone back in and passing that so quickly and responsibly., We anticipate, honestly, this is a real-time event.  The bill might be on its way up here right now, and requires signature by the Speaker, signature by the Senate leadership or the Vice President, and then a signature by the President of the United States.  And so I think that will happen today, but as soon as we get it, the President will take that seriously., Q    Talk to us about the complication of a storm track — and we don’t know the wobbling nature of it, but it looks like it’s going to cover the entire peninsula, running south to north.  How does that complicate emergency management response as it moves up the state?  And to Floridians who are veterans of hurricanes, there is sometimes a tendency to say, I can ride this one out, I’ve seen bad storms before.  Could you address both of those?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yes, of course.  Some people call it “hurricane amnesia.”  Let’s hope there’s no hurricane amnesia, but I would start by saying there are some people — probably some 20 percent of the population — that might not remember or might not have gone through the last big hurricane in Florida.  It was probably 2004 or 2005, right?  There were four major hurricanes in 2004; Wilma in 2005, which was forgotten because of Katrina., \\nIf you haven’t experienced it, take it seriously and ask those who have.  If you have experienced it, please recall that what I just described took place.  You were without power, you were without comms, and you were without water, in some cases, or sewer treatment and so forth for a period of time afterwards.  So plan for that., In terms of the track, there’s three considerations.  The upper-right, northeast quadrant of the storm packs the most punch.  The second consideration is, if the eyewall gets over land, it tends to lose steam a little faster; so if it stays over water, it tends to keep its strength a little longer.  And so as this thing moves left and right, it can affect our operations because it can affect a different part of the state in a different way — wind or flood., What we’ll see here over the next 24 hours is going to tell us which one we’re going to face.  We’re planning for all those eventualities.  I guess maybe worst-case scenario is if it dips down, moves west, and curls around to the other side of the state.  Because right now, it’s my belief that people haven’t been planning for that.  I want to make sure — I’m not suggesting that that’s going to happen, but it seems to be within the cone of uncertainty., And so this storm, at this point, could do everything from Tampa to Jacksonville and a direct hit on Miami.  So please plan for those things accordingly.  Don’t necessarily evacuate based on those eventualities.  Listen to your local officials as they’re tracking it most closely.  But do prepare to be in the storm’s path just in case.  So that’s how we’re doing it., And then lastly, to answer your question, Major, what we’re doing is instead of prepositioning all the commodities in places that might be affected by the storm, to continue support operations to the islands.  The FEMA logistics team have thought through placing those supplies elsewhere, even up to Delaware and New York and elsewhere, so they continue barge operations and to support the islands, and that the next storm doesn’t affect the storm before — if that answers your question., So I can go here., Q    The big question is, after the chemical fire that occurred in Texas, and the fact that you all are being taxed with a second storm, are there any extra precautions that are being taken from this time to ensure that that type of thing doesn’t happen here?  And how taxed is the system for this and for Jose coming in?, MR. BOSSERT:  Well, the system can be taxed in different ways.  I addressed already the lifesaving, life-sustaining operational capabilities that we have, all the USAR teams and so forth which are martialed by the federal government but provided by the states.  They’re all rested and refit and ready to come back into the fight.  Same with the Coast Guard and United States Military National Guard and Title 10 forces., We’re preparing for environmental losses, as we should.  I can’t speak to each and every company’s preparation efforts.  As I stand here, we can continue to monitor that and follow up with you.  There will be steps that are taken, from setting down the nuclear power facility to a position of safety.  I think they take some kind of warm shutdown posture at some point, depending on the track.  So we monitor those things.  I was comfortable with the position of most of them.  But also look at Okeechobee, because that’s going to be a big flooding risk and an overflow risk., Q    Is there anything that you’re not comfortable with right now that is an overriding concern?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, well, we’re worried about the fuel shortages.  We’re worried about whatever worries the governor at this point.  But no, to be honest with you, I am setting expectations appropriately here, because as we go through a storm, nobody is ever happy or completely safe.  But I am extremely comfortable with the government efforts.  Now I want to make sure that people understand that they have a part to play here as well., Q    I have two questions for you if you don’t mind.  Number one, taking a step back and looking a little more big picture, you’ve got wildfires out west, you’ve got the crisis in Texas that people are still recovering from, you have Irma, Jose on its heels.  The resources of the federal government are not unlimited.  At what point do you worry that the resources are being stretched too thin, if you’re not at the point now?, MR. BOSSERT:  No, I don’t — as the Chief of Staff, General Kelly, says, the federal government should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.  He’s absolutely right.  We’ve had Cabinet meetings here today, yesterday, and throughout these storm events focusing on efforts and national security matters around the globe., So I’m pretty comfortable in our ability and our capacity as leaders, but also as institutions to handle the various different things that come our way.  I’m extremely comfortable with President Trump’s capacity to do so.  He’s demonstrated an ability to juggle these issues of complexity on a regular basis, including today., What I do worry about are the financial resources.  Congress came and stepped up in a bipartisan way.  I think President Trump deserves a lot of credit for putting that together over the last 48 hours.  And they have done what the American people really want them to do, and that is act and do what’s right instead of quibbling over things that tend to get in the way of efficient execution of services., And so in this particular case, we’re going to have to go back, I’m sure, for additional resources as these storms continue to hurt our states and our citizens.  But for now, we’re taking a responsible course of action, asking for the money in the appropriate small tranches, and then reassessing and getting better estimates so that we don’t overestimate.  But we’re not doing it in a way that’s going to stop or slow down operations., Q    And my second question — and actually, do you know what a number would be on that yet, or is it too early?, MR. BOSSERT:  On a subsequent request?  No, a little too early.  So as you know, the approximately $7.5 billion that came for FEMA on the supplemental was a calculated estimate.  There’s a $6.8 billion figure, roundabout, that would be a regular scheduled replenishment at the end of the month for FEMA’s disaster relief fund.  Those two together were contemplated.  So we assume passage of both.  The third, or future, request will be based on estimates of information as we refine them., Q    And while we have you here — I know you’re here to focus on Irma, but I’ve got to ask about DACA because there’s still a question of what happens to DACA recipients currently serving in the military.  There’s still no decision.  Can you explain why there’s a delay in explaining to these folks what’s going to happen and when they might be able to expect an answer?, MR. BOSSERT:  No, I can’t.  I can tell you that the President put it back on Congress and then asked for his priorities to be met and their solution., Q    But in the interim window?, MR. BOSSERT:  In the interim window, I’m not sure, to be honest with you, what the answer is on the military part of DACA.  But I thought we were clear.  I’ll find and make sure I get back to you on that., Q    Tom, given Harvey and the flooding and the recovery efforts that you talked about, and then what may happen with Irma, there have been reports that you all are reconsidering the flood — reversing the floodplain regulations that the Obama administration put in.  Can you talk about whether you are, in fact, reconsidering that — either putting back those regulations or drafting new regulations that would once again toughen back up the flood regulations given that we’re going to facing a lot of those issues as both of these places recover?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, no, I won’t necessarily accept the premise of the question, but I will answer the spirit of it.  So it’s not about tough or not tough, it’s about smart or not smart.  And I think the answer here — I think I went out and did this in one of your publications — the answer here is that we shouldn’t use federal money to rebuild in ways that don’t anticipate future flood risk.  So we need to build back smarter and stronger against floodplain concerns when we use federal dollars., What happened in the President’s infrastructure executive order was the rescission of an Obama-era order that had a broad-ranging and overreaching scope into construction permitting.  And at the time that we rescinded it, we did so in the hope of expediting infrastructure development in this country, which I think was a smart move, for what it’s worth.  The President certainly did as well., But now what we have to do is replace with thoughtful — whether it’s an executive order, regulations, or both — building standards and practices for the expenditure of federal money that makes floodplain and risk-mitigation sense., Q    But there will be some kind of affirmative effort to —, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah.  In the interim, I should point out two things here, right?  Not to be defensive, but first, that Obama-era executive order had not turned into a regulation yet.  So nothing in this storm would have changed, whether we acted or didn’t act, if that makes sense.  So this was not an immediate or poorly thought-through step., And then secondly, whether we put forward an executive order or not, we do have the latitude, under the current Stafford Act authorities and other laws to put into these rebuilding practices in Texas and Florida appropriate floodplain management practices.  But we want to make sure we think through how to codify that for the future in the next month., Ma’am., Q    Tom, on Monday, we’re seeing an anniversary — 9/11 — and the nation right now is seeing a lot of vulnerabilities, speaking (inaudible).  What is the threat level?  And what is this administration doing as it relates to moving into this tragic anniversary — remembering this tragic anniversary?, MR. BOSSERT:  Well, I was kind of personally motivated into service on that day.  And that’s why I’ve come back to service here again.  The counterterrorism mission is the one I take the most seriously.  And President Trump will, as Presidents before him and since 9/11, receive a comprehensive picture of the terrorist threat environment and what we’re doing to counter it from his senior officials on 9/11 — or I think on Monday we’ll do this; we’ll get the timing of that to you and we’ll give you a readout., He’ll do that; that’s a practice that we’ve started since 9/11.  And Presidents Bush and Obama maintained that practice.  President Trump intends to do the same.  And then I’ll let the team announce his planned event for — or scheduled events for attending any ceremonies and paying some respects.  But for the most part, I’d encourage the administration — who will, I’m sure, fan out and give appropriate speeches — to show some solemnity that day and not talk too much about policy.  It’s a day of remembrance and respect., Q    What’s the threat level right now as we go into 9/11 and with the vulnerabilities that we are seeing throughout this nation?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, no terrorist should view us as vulnerable right now — farthest thing from the truth, okay?  Second, there is no actionable credible threat to the United States right now.  We’ve run those regular risk-posture meetings here at the White House, and we bring together the entirety of the intelligence community when we do so.  There is no current, credible, actionable threat — terrorist threat — against the homeland.  But we will continue to track that, and if we learn of such a thing, we communicate it to our law enforcement authorities and to the public as soon as we learn it., Q    In addition to the issue of supplies of oil and gas, there’s the issue of price, and gasoline has jacked up about 70 cents a gallon.  I remember in an earlier briefing, you said you would be monitoring to make sure there isn’t gouging.  Are you monitoring beyond the issue of supply and demand?  It does seem to be a pretty bad excuse just to raise prices.  And to make sure that it’s data-based?, MR. BOSSERT:  Yeah, so the idea is trying to determine — it’s a fact-based determination — the difference between gouging and supply-and-demand price indicators.  So I’d ask you to remember one thing:  that refineries, at least five or six of them in Houston, are still down.  So we’ve got a refinery issue on one side, and we’ve got an increased demand issue on the other side.  And so that’s necessarily, generally, going to raise prices, but it’s a short-term price spike in our experience.  We’ll try to differentiate that from gouging as we examine any potential allegations of that practice., But for right now, Floridians are pretty well used to this, and I think they’re pretty well used to their Attorney General prosecuting them in Florida.  So I’m not of the opinion that I have to issue too many warnings from this podium again, but in case anybody missed me last time, gouging won’t be tolerated, period — period.  Okay?, Let me see if I can come back real quickly, because I know Sarah is here and has a lot more to do.  Governor Mapp, Governor Rosello, Governor McMaster of South Carolina, Scott of Florida, Deal of Georgia, and Abbott or Texas — you’re all on our minds.  You’re all our clients.  You’re our customer base right now.  You’re going to set the requirements, we’re going to meet those requirements.  And as Americans, we’re going to get through this., \\nSo remember, I started with inform, influence, and inspire.  I’m pretty certain that the country saw the people of Texas show us what compassion is all about, and I’m pretty sure the Floridians and South Carolinians are going to step up and match that challenge in the next coming days.  Let’s say a little prayer for them, and I’ll come back out and speak to you as the situation dictates., So thank you very much.  Appreciate it., MS. SANDERS:  Thank you, Tom., As you can see, the safety and security of the American people is the President’s top priority, and we’ll continue to work with our local partners to keep the public fully informed as the events unfold., Looking ahead to this weekend, the President and the First Lady will be hosting Cabinet members and their spouses at Camp David.  This will be a working weekend, which will include the fourth Cabinet meeting since the President took office.  That will take place on Saturday.  The President will lead a discussion on the administration’s priorities, in addition to receiving briefings on Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts and preparations for Hurricane Irma., Secretary Mattis will obviously be among the Cabinet members attending this weekend.  And on a lighter note, today happens to be his birthday.  So I’d like to wish Secretary Mattis a happy birthday on behalf of all of us here., Everybody knows I love a good birthday story.  In a letter to his troops in the field in 2003, General Mattis encouraged them to fight with a happy heart and a strong spirit, and to demonstrate to the world that there is no better friend and no worse enemy than a U.S. Marine.  I think it’s safe to say that he has lived his own life by that advice.  And, General, we hope you’re 67th birthday is a good one., With that, I’ll take your questions.  Cecilia., Q    Is this agreement with the Democrats that the President reached a one-off?  Is this something we can expect to see more of — bipartisanship from this White House?, MS. SANDERS:  I certainly think that the goal is to have bipartisan efforts and certainly legislation where you’ve got Republicans and Democrats both working towards it.  That was something that the President talked about during the campaign, and certainly something that I think the American people expect, and one of the reasons they voted for him.  And I certainly would expect to continue to see that., Q    Does the President care at all that Republican leadership is annoyed with this deal that he reached?, MS. SANDERS:  I think that the President’s focus was doing what was best for the American people, and that’s why he’s the President.  The people wanted somebody to be a leader, they wanted somebody that was going to step up and take action and get things done, and that’s exactly what the President did., I think the last thing we want to do is play partisan politics when we have people in places like Texas and Louisiana that need financial support through the federal government.  The President wanted to make sure that happened and that that got taken care, and that’s what he did., John., Q    Sarah, what’s the thinking behind the President working with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to eliminate the need to constantly go through this debt ceiling process?, MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think that if you can take some of that partisan bickering out of the process, that’s probably a good thing.  This is a government that is always going to pay its debts and wants to make sure that our bills get paid and that we can support the needs that we have of our country, like we’re having to do right now in a time of disaster relief efforts.  And so that’s certainly a priority moving forward., Q    But there’s some conservatives in Congress who say taking away the battles over the debt ceiling just means that you’re going to continue to add on debt, add on debt, add on debt, with no checks and balances., MS. SANDERS:  Well, I think that’s if you have your priorities wrong.  The President is focused on, one, balancing the budget, bringing that debt down overall, but also making sure, again, that the citizens of our country, particularly those in a really desperate time of need, like we are seeing right now in Texas and Louisiana, are taken care of., Major., Q    Sarah, about tomorrow — you said it’s important for the public to be fully informed.  I would just suggest you take in due seriousness having the pool be able to cover some portion of that Cabinet meeting at Camp David tomorrow so the country can be fully informed., MS. SANDERS:  We will be releasing some of the President’s remarks from tomorrow and we’ll keep you guys posted on that process and how that will work., Q    In this regard, you talked about eliminating partisan bickering from the debt-ceiling process.  Is that a Republican problem?, ...]

       "322  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 11:12 A.M. EDT, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Good morning.  I wanted to make a brief statement before we start about things that are probably more important than the numbers.  And folks like me sometimes get caught up in the numbers.  I want to talk very briefly about what happened in Manchester, England., The President this morning summed it up emotionally for a lot of us who just called these people who perpetrated this — the one person, there may be more — “evil losers.”  The President has — I think Barron is 11 or 12.  I took my son to his first concert when he was 11 or 12.  And I think all of us who have children that age and take them to concerts, this is something that hits especially close to home., And we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our ally and our friends in the UK, and also have the victims and their families in our hearts as we talk about these other things that somehow pale in comparison., With that said, let’s talk about the budget.  And I know that some of you were here yesterday, and some of what I’ll say at the opening will be a repeat.  But a lot of folks were not here.  So let’s talk about what this is., This is the President’s FY2018 Budget.  The name on the cover is “The New Foundation for American Greatness.”  As I read through it over the weekend, as I did — in fact, we’ve been working on this since before I actually got here — it struck me that the title should have been different; that the title should have been, “A Taxpayer First Budget.”  Because that’s what this is., And as I was trying to reconcile those two things — well, it’s called the “New Foundation for American Greatness,” but I wanted to call it the “Taxpayer First Budget,” that it struck me that that was what was really new, or one of the things that was new about this budget; that we looked at this budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the bills., I think for years and years we’ve simply looked at a budget in terms of the folks who are on the back end of the programs, the recipients of the taxpayer money, and we haven’t spent nearly enough time focusing our attention on the people who pay the taxes., I got a couple questions yesterday — I know I will today — about compassion.  Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation.  Yes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it.  And that is one of the things that is new about this President’s budget., What else is new?  It’s new in that it balances for the first time in at least 10 years.  The last time we looked, we couldn’t find a President Obama budget that balanced ever.  I think he tried a couple times to convince us that primary balance, which was balance without regard for interest payments on the debt, was balanced.  We reject that.  We get to an actual balance on this budget within the 10-year window., It begins to reduce the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy in year one, okay?  That’s how important it was and is to this President to try and bring some fiscal discipline., Again, if you’re looking through the perspective of the people who pay, you’d like to be able to tell them at some point in the foreseeable future, you’re going to be able to balance.  The previous administration completely gave up on that.  As I’ve said before, to the previous administration, if you borrow money — if I take money from you and I have no intention of ever giving it back, that is not debt.  That is theft., And if we’re going to borrow money from people, we have to have a plan for how we are going to pay it back.  And that’s what this budget does, and that’s one of the things that is new about this budget., The next word in the title is foundation.  What is the foundation that we’re trying to build here?  And I sum it up this way — again, I saw an article a couple weeks ago about “What is Trumponomics?” and that Trumponomics is part of the foundation here.  What is it?  It’s sustained, 3 percent economic growth., Everything that we do in this administration, every single time I am called into the Oval Office — whether it’s on immigration policy, healthcare policy, tax reform policy, trade policy, budgets and spending — the focus is sustained, 3 percent economic growth., We have been attacked, stunningly, by some folks on the left and even in the mainstream who say that that’s an unreasonable assumption.  We should stop and think how absurd that is to think that 3 percent growth in an American economy is to some people an absurd assumption.  It used to be normal.  Ten years ago it was normal.  In fact, it’s been normal for the history of the country.  I think the average over the 240-odd years that we’ve been a country has been over 3 percent.  It’s certainly been over 3 percent since World War II., The 1.9 percent growth rates that the previous administration assumed towards the end of their administration, and the 1.9 percent growth rates for the entire 10-year window that the CBO growth rates assume — that the CBO assumes, the Congressional Budget Office assumes, are something we simply reject.  That is a pessimistic look at what the potential for this country and for what this country’s people is.  We reject that pessimism., And so you know what?  We probably should have gone in and assumed 3.5 percent or 4 percent growth because that would be aggressive.  Three percent growth is just getting back to normal., I’ve said it before, I say it again:  If you are 30 years old and you are watching this, or you’re sitting here, you have never had a job as an adult in a healthy American economy.  It’s either been a recession or a slow, sluggish economy stumbling along at less than 2 percent growth., The differences between 2 percent growth and 3 percent growth doesn’t sound like much.  In fact, I cringe when I hear people say it’s only a 1 percent difference.  It’s not; it’s a 50 percent difference.  But that’s just math.  The difference in that is tangible., At 3 percent economic growth in a healthy American economy, if you don’t like your job, you can quit because you know you can go get another job.  If you get laid off, you know you can go off and start your own business.  These are the opportunities that people have forgotten about.  And these are the things, the optimism in the country, the dynamism in the country that the President is so eager to push back and to bring back to the country., It’s what drives every one of our policies, especially when it comes to anything dealing with jobs and the economy.  We will bring back 3 percent economic growth to this country, and those numbers are assumed in this budget., By the way, if you don’t, the budget will never balance.  If you assume 1.9 percent growth, my guess is you’ll never see a balanced budget again.  So we refuse to accept that that’s the new normal in this country.  Three percent is the old normal.  Three percent will be the new normal again under the Trump administration.  And that is, part and parcel, one of the foundations of this budget., Along those same lines, the budget also speaks to and funds a lot of the President’s priorities.  We’ve talked about this since March when we unveiled the budget blueprint.  National security, obviously a priority for this President.  Border security another priority for him.  We can talk at length, if you want today, about the details of the additional money that we spend in those areas., The total plus-up, again, for the 2018 budget is $54 billion over the Congressional Budget Office baseline.  The law enforcement gets a significant increase here, and that’s both at the federal and the state and local level as we follow through on our efforts to enforce the law., Veterans see more money here.  That’s a classic example of looking at the budget through the eyes of the taxpayer.  I put myself in the role of the person who is actually taking the money from you as taxpayer and giving the money to someone else in terms of a benefit.  And if I can look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you so that I can help this injured vet, I can do that in good conscience — I can look you in the eye, and my guess is you’re okay with that — I am a lot less comfortable to the point of not wanting to look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you to give to this person over here who really isn’t disabled but is getting a disabled benefit, or this person over here who is supposed to use the money to go to school, but isn’t actually going, or a program that is supposed to encourage you to graduate from high school — or from college, but is only 6 percent effective., That’s the type of compassion we talk about, and that’s the type of different perspective that we bring to the budget.  And it’s one of the things that I like to talk about when we talk about the veterans.  People don’t mind paying their taxes as long as they know that that money is not being wasted and frittered away., We also increase spending for school choice and paid parental leave, making this President the first President of either party to propose a nationwide paid parental leave program for parents and adopted parents.  There’s $20 billion in that over the course of the 10-year window.  I think I gave an incorrect number yesterday of $25 billion., What are those, by the way?  National security, border security, law enforcement, veterans, school choice, paid parental leave.  They are all — all — campaign promises that the President made while he was running for office., And that’s why I say these numbers are simply the President’s policies put onto paper.  We took the President’s speeches, we took his priorities.  We turned them into numbers, and that’s what it’s in the document., It does not — along the same lines, not a single thing in here touches Social Security retirement or Medicare.  Why?  Because that’s what the President said when he was campaigning, that he would not change those things., In fact, I’ve told the story several times of sitting in the President’s office with a list of possible reforms to mandatory — what some people call entitlement spending — and have the President at the end of the list go:  Yes, yes, no, no, no, no.  And the “no, no, no’s” were always Social Security retirement and Medicare.  Didn’t change those at all because he promised people that he wouldn’t., We can do all that and balance at the same time because we look at spending differently.  We’re no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those programs.  We’re not going to measure compassion by the amount of money that we spend, but by the number of people that we help., And that is how you can get 3 percent economic growth.  That is how you can balance the budget in 10 years.  That is how you can borrow money from people while still promising and intending to pay it back from them.  That is how you can help people take charge of their own lives again, and that is the part of the budget that deals with the American greatness., So with that, I’ll take questions for a little bit.  I know there is a couple.  Yes, ma’am., Q    So President Trump is sticking to his campaign promise not to touch Medicare or Social Security retirement benefits, but not Medicaid.  So how does he intend to square that with his supporters?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  A couple things about Medicaid, and this is one of my favorite stories to tell about Washington spending.  Keeping in mind — and I know that you all probably get this, but if you’re watching this at home — in Washington, D.C., if you spent $100 last year on something, and we spend $100 on it this year — on that same thing — in Washington, people call that a cut.  $100 last year, $100 this year — you all call it a cut., In fact, I’ve seen several occasions where we’ve spent $100 last year, and $102 this year, and many people will still call that a cut — because the budget is hard-wired by the Congressional Budget Office to go up every single year.  And if the Congressional Budget Office says we spent $100 last year, and we’re supposed to spend $106 this year, for a lot of people anything less than $107 is a cut.  In fact, I’ve actually heard $106 referred to as a “freeze” because it simply says in line with the Congressional Budget Office.  A classic example of how Washington speaks differently than the world back home., So a couple things about Medicaid, okay?  There are no Medicaid cuts in the terms of what ordinary human beings would refer to as a cut.  We are not spending less money one year than we spent before.  What we are doing is growing Medicaid more slowly over the 10-year budget window than the Congressional Budget Office says that we should or says that we will under current law., Why do we change it?  We change it — we change those growth rates in Medicaid spending because of the American Health Care Act, which this President does support.  We’ve said from the very beginning we support the House efforts.  We’re looking forward to and are working right now with the Senate, working on what their healthcare bill would look like.  But we support the American Health Care Act, and that does change Medicaid., How does it change it?  And this is something that I don’t think enough people are talking about.  It makes it a lot better and a lot more able to deliver the necessary services to the people who need it.  Here’s how:  Medicaid is funded in large part by the states.  In fact, I was in the state legislature, and our second-largest line item I think after K-12 education was Medicaid.  And we would see this program come down from Washington will all of these instructions on how to use it, and say, goodness gracious, this won’t work in South Carolina., We happen to think, for example, that Medicaid is designed for more of an urban poor population than a rural poor, as predominates in South Carolina.  And we would ask them every single year — would ask them, the federal government — give us more control over how this money gets spent.  We think we can do it better.  We think we can either provide the same services to the same number of people cheaper, or we can provide better service to more people at the same amount of money if you let us do it better.  And the federal government always said no.  In the American Health Care Act, we say yes, and we give the governors and the state legislatures a lot more control over Medicaid., Everyone is interested in seeing the truly needy in their state and in our nation get the care that we promised them in Medicaid.  But there’s a better way to do it than under current law, which is Obamacare.  We can also talk about what a failure that is.  But there’s a better way to do it, and that’s what the American Health Care Act does., In the back.  Yes, sir., Q    Director Mulvaney, you mentioned the previous administration, the stagnant growth, and that the deficit has actually doubled since 2008 from about $10 trillion to $20 trillion.  But a member of that administration, Larry Summers, today actually went on the attack.  I’m curious, how do you respond to his assessment of the budget?  He called it “simply ludicrous,” and that the administration is double-counting the tax cut and the benefit from the growth., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I did get a chance to just see the piece that Mr. Summers wrote, on the way out the door, and the ideas were rushing into my head what I might say to Larry if he were here.  So if he’s hiding in the back, now would be a good time for him to come out and identify himself., I went back and looked at some of the economic assumptions that the Obama administration made in its first couple of years, and I want to say, on a couple of different occasions, their assumed growth rate was more than 4.5 percent.  Keep in mind this is the first administration in history — it was the first decade and the first eight-year period of history not to have a 3 percent growth rate, and yet they were promising us 4.5 percent growth.  So if Larry wants to talk about unreasonable assumptions, we talk about my 3 percent growth rate and his 4.5, and we’ll talk about who actually is closer to reality., Regarding the double-counting, here’s one of the things I think that a lot of folks have overlooked.  And we did it on purpose because it’s sort of hard to count this, and you don’t want to make too many assumptions.  You have to make assumptions about a budget.  You’re talking about a document that will look 10 years into the future.  So it’s natural for administrations from either party to make some assumptions., But one of the assumptions we didn’t make was that we didn’t close any of the tax gap.  For those of you who aren’t familiar with that, the tax gap is the amount of money that we should collect in taxes every single year, but don’t.  2016 — that number is $486 billion.  Almost enough to close the deficit that year.  And we don’t assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform.  Why is that important?  There’s probably two reasons that people — well, three reasons people don’t want to pay tax.  Number one, they just don’t pay tax, and there’s always a certain number of people who don’t want to do that.  Number two, it’s just too hard for them to do it.  It’s too complicated for them to do it.  Two reasons.  Now I feel like I’m a Monty Python skits.  But two reasons., And we think that —, Q    Airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Exactly.  That if it’s a simpler tax code, that people are more likely to pay.  That simply makes sense.  If you can really fill out your tax reform — tax returns on a single piece of paper, you’re much more likely to actually do it.  It’s also easier for us to see if you’re paying the right amount.  A simpler code is easy for you to pay and easy for the government to see if you’re paying the right amount, which would allow us very reasonably to assume a reduction in the tax gap.  And we don’t do a single penny of that., So I’m aware of the criticisms, and I would simply come back and say, look, there’s other places where we were probably overly conservative in our accounting.  We stand by the numbers.  We thought that the assumption that the tax reform would be deficit-neutral was the most reasonable of the three options that we had.  We could either assume that our tax reform was deficit-neutral.  We could assume it would reduce the deficit.  We would assume it would add to the deficit.  And given the fact that we’re this early in the process about dealing with tax reform, we thought that assuming that middle road was the best way to do it., Yes, sir., Q    Thank you, Director.  Can you characterize the treatment of climate science programs and cuts to those?  And do you describe those as a taxpayer waste, if you do not cut them?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  You tell me.  I think the National Science Foundation last year used your taxpayer money to fund a climate change musical.  Do you think that’s a waste of your money?, Q    What about climate science?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I’ll take that as a yes, by the way.  (Laughter.), So you see my point.  What I think you saw happened during the previous administration is the pendulum went too far to one side, where we were spending too much of your money on climate change and not very efficiently.  We don’t get rid of it here.  Do we target it?  Sure.  Do a lot of the EPA reductions aimed at reducing the focus on climate science?  Yes.  Does it meant that we are anti-science?  Absolutely not.  We’re simply trying to get things back in order to where we can look at the folks who pay the taxes, and say, look, yeah, we want to do some climate science, but we’re not going to do some of the crazy stuff the previous administration did., And I will note for the record that you didn’t say anything about the musical., Yes, ma’am., Q    Thank you, Director.  I’m just wondering — you were talking about making assumptions.  What are your assumptions and expectations for the budget in reference to the wall?  I mean, Congress really seems to have come on the record and say they’re not in support of funding it.  So what are you expectations?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Well, some folks aren’t in support of it, some folks are very much in support of it., By the way, I did read something — and I was really disappointed yesterday.  I don’t know if there’s anybody here from the folks who broke the embargo.  But I thought — there was only place — I don’t think it was anybody here.  Somebody did.  But I read the article about how we supposedly dramatically reduced our request for the wall funding.  It’s not accurate.  The 2017 request was $1.5 billion for border security and $3 billion in additional DHS funding.  And the request in the — the proposal in the 2018 is $2.6 billion for border security — almost twice as much — and $4.5 billion for total DHS.  Again, a much larger number than 2017.  So I’m not really sure how the person got to that number., But let me address your question., Q    (Inaudible) the wall —, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  It was.  We are absolutely dead serious about the wall.  In fact, after taking care of national security and the vets, my guess is, it’s in the President’s top three.  In fact, I know for a fact that it is.  And we’ve made that very clear to the folks on the Hill that while we did not get as much money as we wanted for border security in the 2017 omnibus — we didn’t get a lot; many of you were here for the presentation I gave on that — that we will see increased border security between today and the end of the calendar year.  By the same token, we’re going to continue to press on., We do think there’s a role for technology, a role for additional people, all of which we asked for in this 2018 budget request.  But it is absolutely a priority for the President., Yes, sir., Q    You said you reject the premise of the economy not growing at 3 percent., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Yep., Q    Did you set the 3 percent target and then reverse-engineer the figures in order to achieve that?  Give us the math?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  No.  Yeah, keep in mind, we had — because there was a lot of numbers that were floated during the campaign — 3 percent, 3.5 percent, 4 percent, 4.5 percent — and we didn’t start with any of those numbers and work back.  What we sat down and did is this — in fact, it was the group of — it was myself, Secretary Mnuchin, Director Cohn from the NEC, who at the time I think was — still is playing the filling the role often filled by the Council of Economic Advisers.  And what we did is we sat down and said — we looked at the CBO baseline numbers and said, okay, what will our tax policy increase GDP by?  What are the ranges for that?  What will our regulatory policy impact GDP by?  And what could the ranges be for that?  What does repealing Obamacare do for increasing GDP?, By the way, the Congressional Budget Office actually has hard numbers on that.  The Congressional Budget Office assumes that if your repeal Obamacare, it will increase GDP because Obamacare creates a disincentive to work., So we went through the methodology, item by item, and arrived at the 3 percent.  And I also think that you’ll see that, as well, in the ramp-up to that 3 percent.  We don’t assume 3 percent in year one, for example.  I think the assumption for this year is 2.3 percent, then 2.5 percent, then 2.7 percent or 2.8 percent, and then 3 percent out.  So we think it’s a very reasonable and very defensible macroeconomic assumption., Digging a little bit deeper into the numbers, we also think that our numbers regarding the related interest rates and unemployment rates are likewise defensible.  We get a lot of questions, sometimes, about productivity.  We hear these stories now — there was an interesting story in one of the leading newspapers — I can’t remember if was the Times or the Post, yesterday — about a business in Utah that can’t find enough people to work.  And people say, oh, how are you going to grow the economy at 3 percent if we’re already facing a tight employment market?, I’m going to pull the numbers up here to I don’t butcher these.  Of course, as soon as I say that, I can’t pull the numbers up.  The difference between the U6 rate and the U3 rate is — I think the number was in excess of 6 million people.  What does that mean?  The U3 rate is what we call the unemployment rate.  It’s what everybody calls the unemployment rate.  The U6 rate is those folks who are unemployed — they’re in the labor force looking for work but they can’t find it — plus the people who are marginally attached or are working part-time for economic reasons, working part-time because they can’t find full-time work.  That difference, that delta, is over 6 million people.  So we believe that we should be able to drive U3 and U6 together and get those folks into full-time employment.  And that’s one of the ways you get productivity gains., Q    You’re saying that U6, a measure that goes back to 1994, you can have it equal to U3 measure?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  In a properly functioning economy, that would be the case.  Because keep in mind, what’s the difference?  Marginally attached and part-time against your will.  You want to work full-time, but you’re not.  So you’re technically not unemployed, because that’s not the technical definition of the U3 unemployment rate, but you want to be doing more, you want to be more productive, to go back to the economic terms.  And we do believe that if we bring those people back to the job place, they will end up adding to productivity., Q    Director Mulvaney, thanks for doing this.  On the day that he came down the escalator, famously, and became candidate Trump, he said, “We’re going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.  Have to do it.”  I recognize that he’s going to be saving Social Security retirement, but he’s not saving Social Security disability insurance, which benefits more than 10 million Americans.  So is the President keeping his promise on that program?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Thank you for that.  Yes, he absolutely is.  And here’s why.  The fact that it’s called Social Security disability insurance I think is — well, I’ll put it to you this way.  We propose to do parental paid leave in this budget.  Again, the first President of either party to do that.  We propose to do that using the tools that already exist through the state unemployment insurance.  By the way, I think that’s similar to the way that Canada does it now., There are a couple of states — New York, New Jersey, I think California — who already provide statewide paid parental leave.  They do it through their disability insurance programs, their employment disability.  That does not mean that parental leave is unemployment, and it does not mean that parental leave is a disability. It simply means that that program is managed through the infrastructure that already existed at the time it was set up., And the same is true with Social Security disability.  It is a welfare program for the long-term disabled.  It is not what most people would consider to be Social Security., Q    So why do those individuals who presently receive SSDI receive less as a result of this budget?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I hope so — if there are people who are getting SSDI who should not be getting it —, Q    Those people who should be getting, will they receive less?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  No, no, if people are really disabled and there are folks who need this program —, Q    So how are you going to determine who is getting it that shouldn’t be getting it?  So many antifraud programs that exist already., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Yes, that’s a great question, and I could get down in the weeds.  But one of the — we have — one of the proposals we have is actually how we pick the administrative law judges to make — because I think it’s a lifetime appointment on day one, and we try to phase them in to make sure that they’re not — there have been several judges accused of sort of abusing the program., But to your point — your point is an excellent one — we are not kicking anybody off of any program who really needs it.  That’s not — we have plenty of money in this country to take care of the people who need help.  Okay?  And we will do that.  We don’t have enough money to take care of people, everybody who doesn’t need help.  So what we try and do is look at these programs — again, through the perspective of the people paying for it — and say, SNAP, for example — I know I haven’t been asked a question about it —, Q    But wouldn’t 42 million Americans benefit from SNAP?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  42 million Americans?  I thought it was 44; I’ll take your word for it on 42., Q    It’s in the neighborhood., DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  It is.  I think the high was 47, and that was during the recession.  Pre-recession, the numbers were as 28.  It spiked during the recession, which you would expect on a countercyclical program like food stamps.  During bad economic times, more people will go onto food stamps.  So it’s completely within reason to look at that number — it went from 28 million on food stamps before the recession to 47 million at the height. It’s 44 or 42 today.  Yet here we are, eight years removed from the end of the recession.  We’ve had economic growth, albeit slow.  We’re at what we consider to be full employment, with the limitations of U3 and U6.  Why is the number still that high?, Is it possible — if you’re paying for it, isn’t it reasonable for you to at least ask the question, are there people on that program who shouldn’t be on there?  And shouldn’t it be up to the government to make sure we can look folks who are paying the taxes in the eye and say, you know what, we did everything we could to make sure that everybody on SSDI is really disabled.  We don’t think that’s unreasonable.  In fact, we think that is the definition of compassionate — a compassion that is balanced between the people who get the benefits and the people who pay them., Yes, ma’am., Q    Can you talk about provisions affecting federal employees and how to strengthen — your plans to strengthen the federal government?, DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  I’ll deal with federal — let’s talk about federal retirement, because that’s gotten a little bit of a — and that’s one of our largest changes.  Simply put, we try and make federal retirement closer — closer to the private sector.  So we’ve increased the contributions that they make to their 401(k) programs.  I think on one program we got rid of a cost-of-living adjustment that was there.  But keep in mind, those are folks who will also be participating in Social Security at the same time, which is cost-of-living adjusted.  So we thought they were common-sense reforms to try and bring the federal government benefit programs closer to the private sector., I’m a federal worker.  I have a pension and a 401(k).  Raise your hand if you’re in the private sector and you have a pension and a 401(k).  My guess is — oh, one did.  Did you really?  In the back?  Okay, all right.  So she wanted to ask the next question.  So we’re simply trying to get some common sense back into that program.  And we don’t think that’s an unreasonable thing to do.  Again, it’s the right thing to do on behalf of the taxpayers., ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "323  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:13 P.M. EDT, MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  I want to thank Sarah for standing in for me on Friday.  She did a great job.  I missed you all tremendously.  (Laughter.)  Now that I realize that we can do that a little more I’ll spend a little more time at the Pentagon., I moved this up a little bit — I appreciate your flexibility today so that the pool has enough time to cover the Vice President and Secretary Shulkin as they welcome Honor Flight our veterans to Washington on the anniversary of VA Day.  The Vice President is hosting more than 120 veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War as part of National Military Appreciation Month, and Public Service Recognition Week, highlighting the Trump administration’s commitment to our military and public service., Also today, the Vice President, Secretary Price, Secretary Shulkin all attended an event on the scientific opportunities in biomedicine.  Key leaders from government, the private sector and academia discussed the United States’ comprehensive biomedical landscape and further educated White House staff, including assistants to the President, Ivanka Trump and Reed Cordish, on this important topic., The meeting was organized by the National Institutes of Health and was led by its director, Dr. Francis Collins.  Leaders in the medical, education and research joined executives from companies who invest in biotech to provide analysis and real-life examples of how America’s sustained leadership in the biomedical industry has resulted in immeasurable benefits to both our country’s economic and physical well-being., Among the participants were Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Dr. Craig Thompson, the president of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Dr. Cornelia Bargmann, the president of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative;, \\nDr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, president of Stanford University; and Dr. Rick Lifton, the president of Rockefeller University., The United States currently sits atop the list of global investors in innovation in the life sciences, responsible for 44 percent of global research and development.  This investment is dependent on the NIH and the important research it funds.  In order to maintain our international leadership in biomedicine, we must strengthen the partnerships between government agencies, investors, academics, the bio-pharma industry and research foundations.  This meeting was an important step in reinforcing that essential cooperation., Moving on, I’m pleased to announce that today, shortly after this briefing, we will release a list of the President’s third wave of federal court nominees.  These 10 individuals that the President has chosen were chosen for their deep knowledge of the law and their commitment to upholding constitutional principles., Two of the nominees today came from the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that the President released during the campaign.  If confirmed, Justice Joan Larsen will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.  Justice Larsen is currently serving on the Michigan Supreme Court.  And Justice David Stras will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.  He currently serves as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court., The campaign list was put together from the Heritage Foundation, as well as the Federalist Society.  And as the President said last September when it was released, these “highly respected people are the kind of scholars that we need to preserve the very core of our country and make it greater than ever before.”  The President followed the principles that were used to guide that list to select the additional eight individuals.  And as I mentioned, the full list should be out very shortly., In terms of the President’s schedule for today, this morning he met with his National Security Advisor, General McMaster.  He also spoke with the French President-elect to congratulate him on his victory.  A readout of that call should be out very shortly.  The Prime Minister of Georgia was also at the White House, meeting with the Vice President.  The Prime Minister then dropped by with the Vice President into the Oval Office to greet the President.  And earlier this afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President., In about an hour, he’ll meet with Secretary of State Tillerson.  Secretary Tillerson has also been meeting with several foreign leaders today at the State Department, including the Prime Minister of Montenegro, the Foreign Minister of Slovakia, and the Foreign Minister of Qatar., Secretary Mattis is also meeting with many foreign leaders during his European trip this week to reaffirm key United States military alliances.  The Secretary is in Denmark to co-host a meeting with the Danish Minister of Defense, with senior leaders from 15 countries that are key contributors to the ISIS military campaign., While in Copenhagen, Secretary Mattis will also meet separately with the Minister of Defense to discuss European security and the importance of the NATO Alliance, and with the Danish Prime Minister to reaffirm the close ties between Denmark and the United States., In other Cabinet news, Secretary Zinke is in Utah today, continuing his four-day listening tour on the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, putting into action President Trump’s April 27th executive order to review these monuments.  Secretary Zinke will be accompanied by the governor and a number of Utah’s congressional delegation and local stakeholders for a morning aerial tour of the million-plus-acre monument and an afternoon hiking tour and a roundtable meeting this evening with Friends of Cedar Mesa Museum., While in Utah, the Secretary and other officials are holding daily press briefings on the ground.  You can reach out to the Interior Department for more details., And with that, I’d be glad to take a few questions., Kristen., Q    Sean, thank you.  Former President Obama warned then President-elect Trump against hiring Mike Flynn as his national security advisor.  Why did he ignore that?, MR. SPICER:  Well, the President doesn’t disclose details of meetings that he has, which, in this case, was an hour-long meeting.  But it’s true that the President made it — President Obama made it known that he wasn’t exactly a fan of General Flynn’s, which is, frankly, shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obama’s shortcomings, specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting ISIS and other threats around — that were facing America., So the question that you have to ask yourself really is, if President Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn why didn’t he suspend General Flynn’s security clearance, which they had just reapproved months earlier.  Additionally, why did the Obama administration let Flynn go to Russia for a paid speaking engagement, which he did? There were steps that they could have taken — if that was truly a concern, more than just a person that didn’t — had bad blood., Q    I want to follow up on a couple points, because you raised the security clearance.  But before that, if a sitting President raises the name of one individual, why wouldn’t that give the President-elect pause?  I understand what you’re saying, the caveat about the fact of the campaign, et cetera, but wouldn’t that give the incoming President pause?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think that — I don’t know that I agree with your characterization.  He made it clear that he wasn’t a fan of his, and I don’t think that should have come as a surprise considering the role that General Flynn played in the campaign, criticizing his —, Q    It didn’t give him any pause at all?, MR. SPICER:  No.  I think, again, I think if you know what we knew at the time, which is that the security clearance that he had had been reapproved in April of that year, and not only did they reapprove it, but then they took no steps to suspend it.  So the question has to be what did they do if they had real concerns beyond just not having — not liking him for some of the comments that he made., Q    And it’s our understanding — and if you could clarify this — did Mike Flynn not need an upgraded security clearance in order to serve as the national security advisor?, MR. SPICER:  He’d been head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  That’s the same —, Q    And you vetted him, as well, correct?, MR. SPICER:  That’s the same clearance that — the security clearance — we went over this a while ago — it’s the same clearance at any level.  Once you get it, you get it for the time you had — he had his reinvestigation in April of 2016, and the Obama administration took no steps — not only did they reaffirm that security clearance, they took no steps to suspend it or take any other action., Q    But did you not vet him yourselves?, MR. SPICER:  Well, you don’t vet — on a security clearance, that’s why you get a security clearance.  Everyone in the government goes through the same process.  So the answer is, is that those same — that same process worked for General Flynn as it did for me, or for anyone else who works here.  There’s no difference of a security clearance once it’s issued., Zeke., Q    What we do know is what we knew at the time.  So knowing what the White House knows now, does the White House, does the President think that General Flynn should not have had that clearance reissued last year, number one?   And number two, does the White House believe that General Flynn was truthful when he filled out his SF-86 for that reinvestigation last year?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I’m not going to get into those details.  Obviously, that was something that was adjudicated by the Obama administration in April of 2016.  They took no steps to suspend that.  So that’s not really a question for us; it’s a question for them at that time., Q    Knowing what you know now —, MR. SPICER:  I think the President took appropriate action when he did.  Once he felt as though General Flynn had misled the Vice President, he took appropriate action at the time, and he stands by that today., Q    His ties to Russia, and his work as a registered foreign agent now — registered foreign agent for the government of Turkey lead to his firing in February?, MR. SPICER:  Well, again, I don’t think we’re going to re-litigate this.  The President made the right decision back then and he stands by that., Hunter., Q    Thank you, Sean.  Last week, officials indicated that the Pentagon planned to send the President a proposal to send several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan.  Can you confirm whether or not the President has made a decision about sending additional troops to Afghanistan?  And if so, when are they going?  How many are going?  And what is their mission?, MR. SPICER:  I’ll refer you to the Department of Defense on that.  They are in contact with them.  But we have nothing to share at this time., Sara., Q    Thanks, Sean.  The President tweeted this morning that senators on the Intelligence Committee should ask Sally Yates about her role in classified leaks about General Flynn.  Does the President have evidence that ties Sally Yates to the Flynn leaks?  Why did he tweet that?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think you guys are well aware of the President’s concern about spills of classified and other sensitive information out into the open.  It’s something that should concern every American.  And the President has made it very clear since he took office that that’s a big concern of his.  And so the idea that classified information made its way into the press is something that I think, while we’re asking all of these questions, is one of the ones that I think the senators should ask — how did that information get out into the open like that.  I think that is an equally important question that, frankly, isn’t getting asked., Q    But does the President believe that Sally Yates was the leaker in this?, MR. SPICER:  Again, I think the tweet speaks for itself.  What he’s saying is that the Senate should ask those questions., Q    Sean, aside from the announcement today that the President will nominate 10 judges to fill federal vacancies, many conservatives remain concerned the White House is woefully behind on overall appointments.  The President recently told the Examiner — to paraphrase him — that he doesn’t need to fill vacant posts in the administration.  After these 10, there will still be 110 judicial vacancies.  Does the President still believe vacant administration jobs do not need to be filled?  And are there any plans to increase the pace of political appointments?, MR. SPICER:  So there’s like three questions in there.  I’ll try to break them down.  Number one, we have a very robust schedule of releasing names.  There is a method to this in terms of the nominees who are getting put out now, and I think you should expect to see more and more go through.  The process this time around is a little bit different.  We’re actually going through the Office of Government Ethics and FBI clearances before announcing most of these individuals.  And so there’s a little bit of a difference in how we’re doing this.  But we are well on pace with respect to many of these to get the government up and running., But the President’s point that he was making in that interview was that part of the review of government is to make sure that we’re looking at these positions and figuring out whether or not the taxpayer is getting the best bang for their buck both in terms of productivity and cost.  And so we’re looking through the entire government — Director Mulvaney I think briefed you all a while ago about how we look at government to figure out whether or not we can do a better job of filling positions, of staffing the government., But we’re going to continue to have announcements on key positions as this week goes by., Q    — bureaucracy if you don’t fill some of these —, MR. SPICER:  We are.  And that’s what I’m saying.  I think that you’re going to continue to see, whether it’s judicial nominations, ambassadors, other key positions — I think we have a very healthy clip of announcements that continue to go out., Q    Thanks, Sean.  Ahead of her testimony today, does President Trump believe Sally Yates is a trustworthy source of information?, MR. SPICER:  That’s not up for us to decide.  I mean, that is up to the Senate to decide whether or not what she does, and we’ll have to wait and see what that —, Q    And following up on Sara’s question, it seemed that the President was implying that Sally Yates may have had something to do with the leaked information to newspapers.  Is that what he was implying?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the tweet speaks for itself.  Sometimes you don’t have to read too much into it., Richard., Q    Thank you, Sean.  Two questions on NAFTA.  First, the Canadian Prime Minister, on Friday, said that they’re considering, as a reaction to what the Prime Minister calls an unfair, punitive duty on Canadian software lumber — considering banning coal imports from the U.S.  Is this the beginning of a trade war between Canada and the U.S.?, MR. SPICER:  No.  That’s why we have dispute settlement mechanisms, to do this in a responsible way.  Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary, has been in touch with his counterparts over there and I think — look, there’s a reason that the dispute mechanism is set up the way that it is under this particular trade agreement, but under most trade agreements, so that the two parties can resolve them in a way that allows for both sides to air their concerns.  But that’s why you have an agreement and that’s why you have a mechanism set up to do that., Q    So you trust the mechanism on this?, MR. SPICER:  No, no, let’s let it play out.  But I think Secretary Ross took appropriate action to protect the U.S. industry, and we’re going to let the process play out., Q    And 10 days ago, the President said that Mexico and Canada have agreed to fasten the process to renegotiate NAFTA.  What has happened in the last 10 days?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I thin, our officials will start to — we’ll have further updates for you on that.  Right now there is nothing to share., John., Q    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Did Sally Yates have to run any of her planned testimony by the General Counsel’s office that she’ll deliver later this afternoon?, MR. SPICER:  I’m not aware of it, no., Q    And also, do you have any reason to doubt that her testimony, which will be under oath, will be truthful before the Senate Subcommittee?, MR. SPICER:  No.  I would assume that when you raise your right hand and agree to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, that you’ll do that.  That’s the whole reason that you pledge., Francesca., Q    Thank you, Sean.  For weeks during the transition, President Trump was not receiving a daily intelligence briefing; he was receiving his information from General Flynn.  Do you think that lack of direct information from the intelligence community contributed to the lapse in vetting with General Flynn?, MR. SPICER:  So, first, he did get his — we extensively went over the PDB briefing throughout the campaign.  I believe back then it was three times a week that he was getting it, and, supplanted by his national security team, they would go in and do that.  So I think the premise is not there., Secondly, as I mentioned to Kristen, the processes that were followed by General Flynn are followed by every government employee who receives a clearance at that particular level., Q    On another thing, I wanted to talk about the signing statement that came out on Friday with the spending bill.  Senior administration officials, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, didn’t seem to know about that.  Why didn’t she or people working on that issue know about that, know it was coming?  Whose idea was that?  And what happened between when Sarah was out here on Friday saying that she didn’t think there was going to be something like that, and then close of business when there was a signing statement?  And did you know it was coming?, MR. SPICER:  So signing statements are a pro forma activity that occurs during a bill signing that’s performed by the Department of Justice Office of Legislative Counsel.  It’s been used by every President.  So I’m not really sure what everyone knew, but that is something that goes along, going back multiple administrations., Cecilia., Q    Can I follow with HBCUs, on that signing statement, please?, MR. SPICER:  Cecilia., Q    Thanks, Sean.  On the travel ban, a couple questions, if I may.  Back in February, the President said that lifting the travel ban would mean that many bad and dangerous people would be pouring in.  Have you seen any evidence that that’s been the case in the three months since this ban was lifted?, MR. SPICER:  I think that’s a question for the Department of Homeland Security., Q    Well, is that something you’ve been tracking?, MR. SPICER:  Personally, no, but I’d be glad to follow up with the Department of Homeland Security.  I don’t have anything at this time on that., Q    Okay.  In the same vein, if this White House is no longer calling this a “Muslim ban” as the President did initially, why does the President’s website still explicitly call for “preventing Muslim immigration”?  And it says, “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”, MR. SPICER:  I’m not aware of what’s on the campaign website.  You’d have to ask them.  I know how we’ve talked about this from the first day of this administration — as a travel a ban that’s in this country’s national security interest to make sure that the people who are coming in here are coming in here with the right motives.  The reasons that we’re having a public safety aspect to making sure that we’re protecting our people – I think that’s — we’ve been very consistent since the first day of this administration on this., Q    Is it worth standing here, though, and completely disavowing the use of that phrase, “Muslim ban”?  I mean, it’s still on the website.  If the President’s words are being used against him in court today, is it worth you clarifying that once and for all?, MR. SPICER:  I’m trying to figure out why — I’ve been very clear.  I don’t think I need to clarify what we have said or what the President said., Q    Well, it’s stuff that’s coming up in court.  And that’s expected to be —, MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And that’s, frankly, one of the reasons that we have concerns about how that’s being interpreted — because I think the intent of the travel ban was very clear.  I think it was something that the President made very clear in the filings that we have filed why he did it, the motives for doing it.  And he was very clear when he spoke about it from the beginning., So there really shouldn’t be any question as to why the President is doing this, and the idea of making sure that we’re putting the safety of our country and people first and foremost., Tamara., Q    Thank you.  I’ve got two topics, hopefully fast.  So the Kushner family was in China making a pitch for the EB-5 visa program.  This came a day after the President signed the omnibus, which of course extended that program without any changes.  So two questions on that.  One, is it a violation of the conflict of interest agreement that Jared Kushner came to?  And also, does the President believe that that investor visa program needs to be modified in any way?, MR. SPICER:  So I think I would refer you to the company on that.  Jared has done everything to comply with the ethics rules to make sure, and that had nothing to do with him, per se.  He wasn’t involved.  And secondly — I think we’ve talked about this before — the President and Congress are looking at how to look over the entire visa program, all the various visa programs, and whether or not they are serving the purpose that they were intended to, whether or not we’re making sure that we do what’s in the best interest of the American worker.  And so we’re going to continue to work with Congress on that., Q    And regarding the opioid commission, it’s my understanding that no members of that commission have been named yet.  We’re more than 30 days into what was supposed to be a 90-day period for that commission to come back with a report to the President.  What’s up with that?  And does that send the wrong signal to people who believe that this is a very urgent crisis, where like more than 100 people are dying every day?, MR. SPICER:  Right.  Well, let me get back to you on the exact names and the announcement on that.  I’ve got to follow with that.  I think when it comes to the opioid crisis, the President, both during the campaign, the transition, and now as President, has made it very clear of his commitment to figuring out how we can address this crisis that plagues so many neighborhoods and communities.  And he’ll continue to work with — you know, he appointed Governor Christie in a bipartisan commission.  So as soon as w, Q    Sean, can I ask you about the presidential nominees really quickly?, MR. SPICER:  Kevin., Q    Why is it important for the President to get these 10 individuals out there to serve the country?  And on a more broad perspective of this question, there are a number of vacancies — 129 — going into today, to say nothing of some of the openings over there in the EEOB that I’m sure could still be filled.  The pace seems slow.  Is the President aware of that pace?  Is he comfortable with the pace?  And what’s the White House doing, not just to fill those important judicial jobs, but others that are related to the administration?, MR. SPICER:  So on the judicial jobs, obviously we’re going through it in a very methodical way.  As I mentioned earlier, there’s a lot of background that goes on in each of these in terms of the Office of Government Ethics, the FBI background check that goes on.  And so they’re all in pipeline.  I think you’ll continue to see a very robust amount of announcements on not just the judicial front but on several of the fronts., And we’re really — we’ve been tracking where we are.  I think we’re well on pace with where previous administrations have been — some ahead, some a little behind — but we’re doing a great job of filling those key positions and making sure that we get the right person for the right job., ...]

       "324  [Hyatt Regency, \\nAtlanta, Georgia, 1:45 P.M. EDT, MRS. TRUMP:  Thank you, Congressman Rogers.  It is an honor to be with you.  Today, we come together to address an issue that is close to all of our hearts: saving Americans from the disease of opioid addiction., Before I begin, I want to thank members of law enforcement for all they do to protect us each day.  (Applause.)  You are each heroes, and this administration will always honor your life-saving work., In my role as First Lady, much of my focus has been on addressing the terrible toll the opioid epidemic is having on our children and young mothers.  I have seen firsthand both the medical and personal results of this crisis.  I have visited hospitals and treatment centers around the country.  I have met with doctors, nurses, mothers, and children., We will continue to raise awareness of the dangers of opioids to unborn babies.  We are also committed to supporting more treatment facilities that help both mothers and babies recover, and replace the bond of addiction with the bond of love between a mother and her child., Last year, I was grateful for the opportunity to send a video message to the children who attended Operation UNITE’s incredible summer camp.  As I told them, I have launched an initiative to encourage young Americans to “Be Best.”  One of three pillars of this initiative is addressing the opioid epidemic.  I’m proud of this administration’s historic actions to combat this crisis., Together, we are making real progress to help people recover, to support families, and to heal our nation.  My husband is here today because he cares deeply about what you’re doing to help the millions of Americans affected by the opioid epidemic., This afternoon, he has an important message to share.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my pleasure to introduce the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  We love that song, but let’s get going.  Right?, I want to thank you all, and I want to thank, especially, Melania — she works so hard — and those moving words, even though it is from your wife, so she’s maybe a little bit prejudiced in that way.  But I will say that she is a hard worker and has a profound commitment to building a drug-free future for America’s children.  We’re going to do it too.  We’re going to do it.  (Applause.)  Made a lot of progress., Today, I’m honored to join the thousands of leaders — and that’s what you are: leaders — from across the country for the 2019 Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit.  Very important.  Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal: to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all.  (Applause.)  It’s happening.  It’s happening.  That’s happening., I want to recognize the founder of Operation UNITE for his unwavering community service, for his incredible commitment, and to address this critical issue: Congressman Hal Rogers.  A friend of mine for a long time.  And I want to thank you very much, Hal, wherever you may be.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, Hal.  Good job.  Very dedicated guy., We’re also grateful to Operation UNITE’s President and CEO, Nancy Hale.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Nancy., And thanks also to an outstanding public servant, a man who works day and night.  No matter when I need him, he’s there.  I’ll call him at the strangest hours.  He’s always there working.  Secretary Alex Azar.  It’s really great, Alex, what you’re doing.  (Applause.)  Thank you., And CDC Administrator, Dr. Robert Redfield, who is helping us to eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2030.  And we’re there; we’re going to be able to do that.  People are shocked.  Please, stand up, Doctor.  So important.  (Applause.)  I said that recently in a speech: We will eradicate AIDS by 2030.  We’ve made such incredible progress.  And they didn’t know what I was talking about.  They couldn’t believe it.  They came up to me after the speech, Doctor.  They said, “Do you mean that?”  That’s right — we’re going to have it eradicated by 2030.  Thank you very much, Doctor.  Very important., Also with us is the Lieutenant Governor of this great state, a friend of mine and a man who — he’s worked so hard with Brian.  The combination of Jeff Duncan and Brian has been pretty much unbeatable.  They’re doing a fabulous job.  Jeff, thank you very much.  Jeff, where are you?  Jeff?  (Applause.)  Jeff, thank you.  Stand up, Jeff.  Great job.  Really great job.  And, Mrs. Duncan, thank you very much., \\nAnd the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr.  Chris, thank you.  (Applause.)  Tough guy.  And he’s in there fighting for us.  I know that., As well as members of Congress: Rick Allen, Drew Ferguson, Barry Loudermilk, and Jody Hice.  We have them all.  We have them all.  (Applause.)  That’s a pretty unbeatable group.  We’ve been doing okay together, haven’t we?  Huh?  We’ve been doing good., To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis — and a crisis it is — you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation.  You may not even know it, but our nation loves you and they love what you’re doing.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.), You are the first responders who bring patients back to life.  You are the law enforcement officers who bring drug traffickers to justice.  You are the doctors, nurses, and counselors who give struggling citizens the hope and solace and strength to build a brighter and brighter future.  And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom., My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you, and to fight right by your side.  And that’s what we’re doing., We will not solve this epidemic overnight, but we will stop — there’s just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it.  I know some of the people in this room.  Nothing stops you.  Nothing stops you, I can tell you., We will never stop until our job is done, and then maybe we’ll have to find something new.  And I hope that’s going to be soon.  But we will succeed.  We have results that are unbelievable; numbers that I heard, two weeks ago, that I was shocked to hear.  We’re making tremendous progress., Each year, more than 70,000 precious American lives are lost to the opioid and drug crisis.  And, in my opinion, the number is much higher than that., To protect all Americans, my administration declared the opioid epidemic a nationwide public health emergency.  A big step.  Since then, we have secured a record $6 billion in new funding to combat the opioid crisis, and that’s the most ever.  And we’re going for even bigger numbers this year.  (Applause.), Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act — the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nation’s history.  It’s the largest ever., Following the recommendation of my Surgeon General and many others, last year the distribution of the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, increased by over one million units.  Pretty amazing stuff., To expand access to treatment, recovery, and other crucial activities and services, all throughout our nation we have given opioid response grants to states, totaling a record $2 billion., We are now allowing states to use Medicaid funds to pay for residential treatment facilities, and they’re being built all over the country.  In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent.  No other President did that.  No other President.  We have no choice.  We have no choice.  (Applause.), We passed the CRIB Act to expand treatment for mothers and their babies who are born physically dependent on opioids., For our nation’s veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017.  Think of that — 43,000.  (Applause.)  ,  [Forty-three thousand]., And, by the way, for the veterans, 45 years they’ve been trying to get it.  As you know, just recently, I signed Veterans Choice, where a veteran can go, and if the wait is going to be days or weeks or months — which it used to be — they go out and see a private doctor.  (Applause.)  Take immediate care.  We pay for it.  We take care of it.  And it’s been an incredible — it’s new and it’s been incredible, the difference it’s made., And just months ago, I signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law.  (Applause.)  Among other critical changes, the FIRST Step Act provides addiction treatment to Americans in prison., And I’m pleased to report that, in just four months, more than 16,000 inmates are participating in new drug treatment.  (Applause.)  And criminal justice reform — I have to say, people are getting out of prison.  And since our founding, they were having an impossible time getting a job.  But because our economy is doing so well, perhaps the best it’s ever been in our history — best unemployment numbers in history, best everything.  Because of this — (applause) — because of this, prisoners getting out are signing in; they’re getting jobs.  And I can tell you that those employers — because I speak to a lot of them — are thrilled.  They had no idea.  I’m so proud of that., So, the great economy has made it much easier.  They get out, and then they have to prove themselves.  They never got a chance to prove themselves.  Now they prove themselves, and they are doing a spectacular job.  Not all of them, but there’s nothing “all” about any of us.  But they are doing a spectacular job., So I want to thank all of you.  And I want to thank — Congressman, I want to thank you for helping me with that, because you were very instrumental.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.), The Department of Labor is expanding federal efforts to help recovering Americans find a great job in our soaring economy., As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction.  They’re getting a second and third and, in some cases, a fourth chance.  And they’re making it.  They’re making it.  And they really have something to live for.  Some of them say, “We love getting up in the morning.  We love going to work.  We love our job.”  And if they don’t like the job because of what’s happened, it’s a miracle.  All over the world, they’re talking about what’s happened with our economy.  If they don’t like their job, they have choice also, like the vets.  They have choice.  It’s choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better.  Big impact., Last year, a record 73 percent of the new jobs went to people who were out of the workforce and are now coming back to work for the first time in many years.  (Applause.)  And these newly employed citizens are joining 5.5 million more workers who have found jobs since the election, driving our national unemployment rate to its lowest level in 51 years., And, as you know, and you’ve heard me say it, African American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country.  Asian American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country.  Hispanic American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country., People that graduate without a high school diploma — it’s a big group — lowest in the history of our country.  Women — sorry — lowest in 61 years.  (Laughter.)  But we’ll soon have the record.  (Applause.)  We will soon have the record.  We’re going to have that record, too., We’re all Americans.  We are all one family.  And we know that we are strongest when no one is left behind., My administration is committed to ensuring that every citizen can live with dignity and purpose and proudly pursue the American Dream., Critical to this effort is my administration’s strong support for faith-based initiatives.  (Applause.)  America is a nation that believes in the power of prayer and the strength of fellowship, and we believe in the grace of God.  And we’re proud of it.  (Applause.), Here with us today is Dr. Monty Burks.  Nineteen years ago, Monty turned his life around when two women of prayer from his hometown church helped him to get on a path to recovery.  Now Monty works for Tennessee’s — what a great state — Department of Mental Health and is Director of their Faith-Based Recovery Initiative., Monty, please, come up and tell us a little bit about your work.  (Applause.), \\nDR. BURKS:  In awe, honor, and humbled.  The opposite of addiction is relationship.  That simple equation is what helped me find my freedom.  Criminal justice intervention led me to treatment, which led me to recover, which put me on this podium., I’ve been blessed to serve under Commissioner Williams — and Commissioner Varney past before.  They took a chance on a broken and bruised person who had been touched by the system, but they knew that I had a purpose, and my purpose was to use the pain that I’d went through to help other people not have to go through the same thing that I’d went through., You see, recovery is real.  We do recover.  We do recover.  (Applause.)  To me, the paradigm shifts with the faith community.  Our governor, Bill Lee, supports the faith-based community being the catalyst to change, to control the narrative, to explain how people and recovery can come back and be fruitful and change the paradigm themselves, in their own communities.  (Applause.), Employers trust the faith community.  We go back to work not just for a job but for a career, so we can go back and lead as peers so those who were behind us crying in the wilderness will have a second chance to stand before a podium like this and tell you that, yes, recovery is real.  We do recover.  (Applause.), Secretary Azar, I want to thank you for your work with HHS and the Office of Faith-Based with Shannon Royce and Heidi.  And they spread the word and the message about faith-based recovery and treatment across the state.  Today, this is my pulpit, and I have to say this: Someone in a program hears me right now and says, “I can, because you did.  I can, because he did.”  That’s right.  Yes, you can.  Look in the mirror.  There is your miracle., I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this space to stand beside you.  I want to thank God for you and the First Lady and your support of the recovery community.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Wow, that’s great, Monty.  And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone — this is the new way of doing it — (laughter) — and he never looked at it once.  (Laughter.)  That’s a pretty good job.  Thank you very much, Monty.  Appreciate it.  Fantastic., My administration has also embarked on an unprecedented effort to shut down online criminal networks, crack down on illegal international shipments, and stop the deadly flow of drugs into our country., In the past two years, Customs and Border Protection seizures of meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl at the southern border are up 45 percent and going up much higher.  We are seizing it all over.  You probably saw the numbers today.  We are detaining, capturing — call it anything you want — more people than ever before.  Some of those people are not people we want in our country., And I will say Border Patrol has been incredible.  There’s never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico.  Mexico is starting to detain and bring back to their country, where they came from.  But a lot of it is drugs, and drugs are being gotten by us.  We are stopping the drug flow as much as we can.  Soon, we’re going to have a wall that’s going to be a very powerful wall.  It’s under construction.  The media doesn’t like talking about it.  (Applause.)  The media doesn’t like talking about it.  It’s one of many things we’re doing., But when that wall is finished, we intend to have almost 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.  We’re probably ahead of schedule a little bit.  That’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country., And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that that you can buy.  Hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have.  And I always say this: Because as good as that equipment is — and it’s genius — the greatest equipment in the world is a dog.  (Applause.)  Dogs — a certain type of German Shepherd in particular.  Dogs do a better job than 400 million dollars’ worth of equipment.  Can you believe that?  Only the dog lover would understand that, right?  (Applause.)  No, it’s true., I said to the Border Patrol the other day — they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment.  And, you know, it’s hundreds — we’re close to 500 million dollars’ worth of equipment at the ports of entry.  I said, “How does this compare to those great dogs I saw?”  They say, “Sir, honestly, the dogs are better.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “You got to be kidding.”  It’s incredible, and they showed me, and it’s actually incredible.  But we also have a lot of dogs, and they’re great dogs, and we cherish them., Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border.  We’re doing everything to empower ourselves so that we can keep this poison out of our communities and away from our children.  You’re going to see some very, very big differences in the coming months.  We’re capturing people that you wouldn’t believe., And if you remember, when I announced that famous run, when I came down — I’m sure nobody saw this.  When I came down the escalator with Melania and her white dress — I don’t think anybody saw that — (laughter) — but I made a very strong statement about the border and I was criticized.  They said, “Oh, it’s not that bad.”  Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality.  Peanuts.  It was small-time, compared to reality., But we are confronting reality and confronting the grave security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border.  And that’s why I’ve declared a national emergency, which is exactly what it is.  (Applause.), And we’ve secured historic funding to strengthen border security, including the equipment, including the wall, including more Border Patrol agents — including many other things that you don’t even have to know about and some you don’t want to know about., Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws.  (Applause.)  We could solve the entire problem — I say “45 minutes,” but it could go a lot quicker than that; let’s bring it down to 15 minutes — if the Democrats would agree to do certain basic, commonsense things with respect to our laws., And I do think that there’s pressure being put on them, and I think that some of them really do want to do the right thing.  I’ve spoken to some recently, and you might be surprised at what’s going to happen.  But they see what’s going on at the border.  It’s very easy to see.  And they’re seeing the drugs and they’re seeing the human trafficking.  The human trafficking has — it’s like never before in our history.  And this is a world problem, and it’s happening all over the world, but for us, it’s through the southern border., Today, we’re grateful to be joined by Virginia State Police Senior Special Agent Tom Murphy, who has been chasing down drug traffickers for decades.  In recent years, he has seen a surge of cheap heroin being trafficked from Mexico, which is now being laced with ultra-lethal fentanyl., Tragically, a year and a half ago, Special Agent Murphy’s own son died from an overdose of this kind of deadly drug.  And it is deadly., Special Agent Murphy, America’s heart breaks for you and for all of the families that have suffered so needlessly.  No other family should have to experience the pain and the sorrow that you’ve endured., Would you please come up to say a few words?  Please, Special Agent.  Thank you.  (Applause.), SPECIAL AGENT MURPHY:  Thank you, Mr. President and First Lady, for this time and opportunity to speak.  Both professionally and personally, Hal has touched my life and my family’s life., I worked for the State Police of Virginia for 31 years, assigned to a narcotics division drug enforcement section for 23 of those 31 years.  I sat in your seat four years ago, at this same conference.  While I was here four years ago, my son Jason was battling drug addiction., His story is one that’s all too common today.  He grew up with ADD, depression, and was medicated at a young age.  Prior to 18 years old, he started self-medicating with marijuana.  He knew at 18 years old he had to move out of the house because Dad is Dad, and Dad is a police officer, and you can’t do that at home., Well, on his 18th birthday — on the day he turned 18 — he moved out of our home.  He would later tell me it’s the worst decision he’s ever made in his life., When he did so, about a year or two later, he had a work-related injury where he severed four fingers from his hand.  He was introduced to opioids, which was my greatest fear.  I would see him around town, and my wife — you could his physical decline.  He’d been arrested a couple of times for possession and distribution to continue his habit., Twelve days before Christmas — (applause) — December 13th, 2017, 12 days before Christmas, he passed away of a heroin and fentanyl overdose., People talk about stigma associated with opioids, heroin, drugs.  There is a stigma, and the stigma needs to stop.  (Applause.), If you want to think about stigma, think about a family that’s been though it professionally and personally.  And my family has.  And that’s only one family of 70,000 in 2017 who lost a loved one because of opioids and heroin., The stigma needs to stop.  You need to share your story.  I wear two bracelets every day since my son’s death.  On my right wrist is a purple bracelet to honor those who have fallen from drug overdose.  It has his name on it and date and birth and date of death.  On my left wrist, I have two: Thin Blue Line and I’ve got another one that simply states, “Every overdose is someone’s child.  Don’t judge.  Educate.”  (Applause.), So that’s why we’re here and that’s why you’re here.  You took the first initiative, maybe, if you’re here for the first time, to collaborate, to brainstorm, to strategize, to figure out this problem collectively.  But the message I want to convey today is: Don’t judge.  There are 70,000 different stories that happened in 2017.  You heard my son’s.  His name was Matthew Jason Murphy.  Thank you.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  You know, I think I can say with surety that your son, your boy, is looking down right now at you and he’s very proud of his father.  Very, very proud.  Thank you.  (Applause.), We are making great progress to stop fentanyl from coming into our communities.  As a result of my negotiations with President Xi of China — doing a very big trade deal — they’ve announced that next week they will implement new measures to prevent Chinese fentanyl — which is most of it; almost all fentanyl comes from China — from being shipped to the United States.  (Applause.), And furthermore — and I appreciate this, from President Xi — they’ve agreed that they’re going to make it a major crime.  It’s not a crime now.  It’s down as an industrial drug.  And they’re going to make it a crime, and they’re going to charge people with the highest level of crime.  And, in China, unlike in our country, the highest level of crime is very, very high.  It’s the ultimate.  You pay the ultimate price.  So I appreciate that very much., Since I signed the STOP Act into law, our amazing Customs and Border Protection officers have stopped over six times more packages from reaching American doorsteps.  It’s a big deal., Right here, in Georgia, Customs and Border Protection officers at the seaport in Savannah recently discovered an estimated 19 million dollars’ worth of cocaine in a shipment of Colombian pineapples., Today, we’re proud to be joined by two officers who helped find those deadly drugs: James Long and Derrick Nobles.  And thank you both for your courageous work.  Where are you, folks?  Where are you?  Come on.  Come on up here.  Come up.  (Applause.)  Please., OFFICER LONG:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you all for having us here, first of all.  And again, thank you for all your support.  It’s been a — it’s been a long road, and we’re glad to have the President behind us.  I’m glad to have you all behind us on the law enforcement side and the community itself, because you all are our biggest help with finding this.  It’s like finding a needle in the haystack, on most days., But again, thank you all every day for your support.  Thank you., THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you both very much.  Great job.  So many incredible people that I’ve met doing exactly what you’re doing., To all of the Customs and Border Protection officers, DEA agents, and state and local law enforcement that are here today: We love you, we support you, and we are with you all the way.  All the way.  (Applause.), You know, we had billions of dollars of military equipment, which the previous administration, for their own reason, was not willing to give up to law enforcement.  And I decided that we will.  This was beautiful, great, strong, powerful equipment, safety equipment.  You know exactly what I’m talking about.  And we gave billions and billions of dollars throughout the United States to law enforcement., And it’s had a tremendous impact because — I don’t know if it’s for that reason.  Probably not.  It’s probably because of the great men and women involved.  But the numbers are way down.  Crime — way down.  So, thank you all very much.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.), My administration is also taking aggressive action to reduce the over-supply of highly addictive prescription drugs., The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioids.  And earlier this week, the United States filed criminal charges against the sixth- largest drug wholesaler for illicit distribution of opioids — (applause) — because we are holding big pharma accountable.  They should be accountable.  (Applause.)  And they didn’t give to my campaign.  I don’t want their money.  (Laughter.)  They gave to a lot of other campaigns; that’s the problem.  But we are holding them — I couldn’t care less.  They’ve got to do what’s right.  Doing a lot of things., We’re also working very strong on drug pricing.  It’s coming way down.  For the first time — (applause) — for the first time in 54 years, drug prices went down this year.  They went down a little below even.  That’s a big thing.  First time in 54 years.  And I give great credit to you, Alex, for that.  You and your whole group of wonderful people.  Alex was a very, very successful executive at one of the biggest of the companies, and he understood the system better than anybody.  And we’re lucky to have him.  He has done an incredible job.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.), Many drug companies are giving European countries a better deal than they give their own country.  And that has to stop.  We’ve already informed them that’s stopping.  We are making sure that our great seniors on Medicare will share in the discounts given to other countries.  (Applause.)  And you know what that means.  The sophisticates out there that do this for a living, you know exactly — that’s a big deal.  Sounds like big deal, but it really is a big deal., At long last, we’re stopping the drug companies and foreign countries from rigging the system — I know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me.  (Laughter and applause.)  I think you know what I’m talking about.  Unfortunately, that will be your sound bite tonight, but that’s okay.  (Laughter.)  System was rigged.  But rigging the system against our great seniors., And to help doctors and scientists develop non-addictive painkillers, we have nearly doubled funding for opioid and pain research.  Thank you very much, Doctor.  Come on.  Stand.  (Applause.)  He gives away more money than any human being on Earth.  Thank you.  Great.  Such an important — if we can find that answer, that’s going to be a big — that’s going to solve most of the problem, I suspect.  How close are we?  (Laughter.), ...]

       "325  [State Dining Room, \\n10:53 A.M. EST, THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  And I want to thank our Vice President for that really lovely introduction.  That was very nice, Mike, and I appreciate it., This is a time of great opportunity for our country.  We’ve created nearly 3 million jobs since the election — a number that nobody would have thought possible.  You go back and take a look at what they were saying just prior to the election.  Nobody thought it was even possible., And we’ve done many other things, as you know.  And I won’t go over them because I want to be hearing from you today, but many other things that, frankly, nobody thought possible.  GDP — 3.2, 3, 3.  I think we’re going to have another really big one coming up this current quarter, maybe a number that nobody would have thought would ever be hit.  But I think we’re going to have a very good number because of the stimulus, because of the massive tax cuts that we’re all benefitting — whether you’re a Republican or Democrat, you’re benefitting tremendously from those tax cuts., Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States.  And you look at what’s going on, it’s really quite something.  You just read, a week ago, Exxon is now coming in with $50 billion — and many, many companies., Also, something that nobody expected — they’re also coming in with massive bonuses for their workers.  Nobody thought in terms of that.  We know that everybody is going to get a lot more income, and we’ve seen that as of February 1st.  Everyone is saying, “Wow, I have an extra $250 in my paycheck.”  And that’s pretty good stuff.  So we knew that was going to happen., We didn’t know that hundreds and hundreds of companies, millions and millions of people were going to be getting large bonuses because of what we did., And one of the things we’re working on is fair and reciprocal trade deals.  We’re not being treated fairly.  You, as governors, are not being treated fairly.  And when I get too tough with a country, you’re always calling, “Oh, gee, don’t do that.”  But I must say, it’s more senators and congressmen and women that call.  You haven’t been calling so much.  You want to see great deals., But we have to make the deals fair.  You know, with Mexico, as an example, we probably lose $130 billion a year.  Now, for years, I’ve been saying — for the last year and a half, I’ve been saying $71 billion, but it’s really not.  And they have a VAT tax of 16 percent, and we don’t have a tax.  And, at some point, we have to get stronger and smarter, because we cannot continue to lose that kind of money with one country., We lose a lot with Canada.  People don’t know it.  Canada is very smooth.  They have you believe that it’s wonderful.  And it is — for them.  Not wonderful for us; it’s wonderful for them.  So we have to start showing that we know what we’re doing., World Trade Organization — a catastrophe.  China became strong — you look at it.  It was going like this for years and years and hundreds of years, it was going just like this.  I’m a great — I have great respect for President Xi, by the way.  So I’m not blaming them.  I’m not blaming Mexico.  I’m not blaming anybody.  I’m blaming us because we did such a poor job for so many years., I’m not just talking about President Obama.  I’m talking about many, many, many Presidents — for 30 years, 35 years.  But the World Trade Organization makes it almost impossible for us to do good business.  We lose the cases, we don’t have the judges.  We have a minority of judges.  It’s almost as bad as the 9th Circuit.  Nothing is as bad as the 9th Circuit.  (Laughter.)  It’s almost as bad., Speaking of that, DACA is going to be put back into the 9th Circuit.  You know, we tried to get it moved quickly, because we’d like to help DACA.  I think everybody in this room wants to help with DACA.  But the Supreme Court just ruled that it has to go through the normal channel.  So it’s going back in, and there won’t be any surprise., I mean, it’s really sad when every single case filed against us is in the 9th Circuit.  We lose, we lose, we lose, and then we do fine in the Supreme Court.  But what does that tell you about our court system?  It’s a very, very sad thing.  So DACA is going back, and we’ll see what happens from there., So we want fair trade deals.  We want reciprocal trade deals.  Scott Walker has a wonderful company called Harley Davidson in Wisconsin.  Right?  Great.  So when they send a motorcycle to India, as an example, they have to pay 100 percent tax — 100 percent., Now, the Prime Minister, who I think is a fantastic man, called me the other day.  He said, “We are lowering it to 50 percent.”  I said, “Okay, but so far we’re getting nothing.”  So we get nothing, he gets 50 [percent], and they think we’re doing — like they’re doing us a favor.  That’s not a favor.  And you know what I’m talking about., It’s a great company.  When I spoke with your chairman or the president of Harley, they weren’t even asking for it because they’ve been ripped off with trade so long that they were surprised that I brought it up.  I’m the one that’s pushing it more than they are, but it’s unfair.  And India sells us a lot of motorbikes., So when they have a motorbike — a big number, by the way — they have a company that does a lot of business.  So they have a motorcycle or a motorbike that comes into our country — the number is zero.  We get zero.  They get 100 percent, brought down to 75; brought down, now, to 50.  Okay., And I wasn’t sure — he said it so beautifully.  He’s a beautiful man.  And he said, “I just want to inform you that we have reduced it to 75, but we have further reduced it to 50.”  And I said, “Huh.”  What do I say?  Am I supposed to be thrilled?  And that’s not good for you people, especially as governors.  It’s just not right.  And we have many deals like that., Now, with all of that being said, let’s talk China.  Because China, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade — $504 billion.  I think that President Xi is unique.  He’s helping us with North Korea — who, by the way, wants to talk, as of last night; you heard that.  They want to talk.  And we want to talk also, only under the right conditions.  Otherwise, we’re not talking., You know, they’ve been talking for 25 years.  Other Presidents should have solved this problem long before I got here.  And they’ve been talking for 25 years.  And you know what happened?  Nothing.  The Clinton administration spent billions and billions of dollars.  They gave them billions.  They built things for them.  They went out of their way, and the day after the agreement was signed, they continued with nuclear research.  It was horrible., The Bush administration did nothing — both.  The Obama administration wanted to do something.  He told me it’s the single biggest problem that this country has.  But they didn’t do anything.  And it would have been much easier, in those days, than it is now.  I think most people understand that.  But we’ve been very tough with them., China has been good, but they haven’t been great.  China has really done more, probably, than they’ve ever done because of my relationship.  We have a very good relationship, but President Xi is for China, and I’m for the United States.  And Russia is behaving badly because Russia is sending in what China is taking out., So China is doing pretty good numbers, but Russia is now sending a lot of stuff in.  But I think they want to see it come to an end also.  I think everybody does — talking about tremendous potential loss of lives; numbers that nobody has ever even contemplated, never thought of., So they want to talk.  First time — they want to talk.  And we’ll see what happens.  That’s my attitude: We’ll see what happens.  But something has to be done., Today, I want to hear your ideas on a number of critical issues.  But, most importantly, we want to discuss the public safety in schools and public safety, generally.  But school safety.  We can’t have this go on., I’m grateful that Governor Rick Scott is here, and we thank him for his leadership in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy in Parkland, Florida.  Horrible.  Our nation is heartbroken.  We continue to mourn the loss of so many precious, innocent young lives.  These are incredible people.  I visited a lot of them., But we will turn our grief into action.  We have to have action.  We don’t have any action.  It happens, a week goes by, “let’s keep talking.”  Another week goes by, we keep talking.  Two months go by — all of the sudden, everybody is off to the next subject.  Then, when it happens again, everybody is angry and “let’s start talking again.”  We got to stop., By the way, bump stocks — we’re writing that out.  I’m writing that out myself.  I don’t care if Congress does it or not.  I’m writing it out myself, okay?  (Applause.)  You put it into the machine gun category — which is what it is — it becomes, essentially, a machine gun, and nobody is going to be able to — it’s going to very hard to get them.  So we’re writing out bump stocks., But we have to take steps to harden our schools so that they are less vulnerable to attack.  This includes allowing well-trained and certified school personnel to carry concealed firearms.  At some point, you need volume.  I don’t know that a school is going to be able to hire a hundred security guards that are armed.  Plus, you know, I got to watch some deputy sheriffs performing this week.  And they weren’t exactly Medal of Honor winners.  All right?, The way they performed was, frankly, disgusting.  They were listening to what was going on.  The one in particular, he was then — he was early.  And then you had three others that probably a similar deal a little bit later, but a similar kind of a thing., You know, I really believe — you don’t know until you test it — but I really believe I’d run in there, even if I didn’t had a weapon.  And I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too, because I know most of you.  But the way they performed was really a disgrace., Second, we must confront the issue of mental health.  And here is the best example of mental health.  This kid — they had 39 red flags.  They should have known.  They did know.  They didn’t do anything about it.  That was really a bad time, I have to tell you.  Nobody bigger for law enforcement than I am.  But between the people that didn’t go into that school and protect those lives, and the fact that this should have been solved long before it happened — pretty sad., So we have to confront the issue, and we have to discuss mental health, and we have to do something about it.  You know, in the old days, we had mental institutions.  We had a lot of them, and you could nab somebody like this.  Because, you know, they did — they knew he was — something was off.  You had to know that.  People were calling all over the place., But you used to be able to bring him into a mental institution, and hopefully he gets help or whatever — but he’s off the streets.  You can’t arrest him, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything, but you know he’s like a boiler ready to explode, right?  So he just — you have to do something.  But you can’t put him in jail, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything., But, in the old days, you would put him into a mental institution.  And we had them in New York, and our government started closing them because of cost.  And we’re going to have to start talking about mental institutions, because a lot of the folks in this room closed their mental institutions also., So we have no halfway.  We have nothing between a prison and leaving him at his house, which we can’t do anymore.  So I think you folks have to start thinking about that., Third, we have to improve our early warning response system so that when friends, family, and neighbors do warn the authorities about a violent or dangerous individual, action is taken quickly and decisively.  Look, you had the one mother — you remember, in Connecticut, how horrible that was.  She was begging — begging — to take her son in and help him — do something, anything, he’s so dangerous.  And nobody really listened to her.  And he ended up killing her, and then the rest.  You know what happened.  It was a horror.  But she was begging to do something about her own son., Recently, you had a grandmother that got to see the notes of her grandchild, and she reported him.  And they nabbed him.  He was ready to go in for a school — looked like.  She reported him.  And there, the law enforcement did a very good job., Fourth, we must pursue commonsense measures that protect the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans while keeping guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others., And fifth, we must strive to create a culture in our country that cherishes life and condemns violence and embraces dignity., Now, with all of that, over the weekend — I cannot believe the press didn’t find this out, I can’t believe it.  I think they’re getting a little bit — I could never use the word “lazy”; you don’t want to say that.  We don’t want to give them any more enthusiasm than they already have.  But I can’t believe they didn’t figure this one — because I had lunch with Wayne LaPierre, Chris Cox, and David Lehman of the NRA.  And I want to tell you, they want to do something.  And I said, “Fellas, we got to do something.  It’s too long now.  We got to do something.”, And we’re going to do very strong background checks — very strong.  We got to do background checks.  If we see a sicko, I don’t want him having a gun.  And, you know, I know there was a time when anybody could have — I mean, even if they were sick, they were fighting.  And I said, “Fellas, we can’t do it anymore.”  And there’s no bigger fan of the Second Amendment than me, and there’s no bigger fan of the NRA.  And these guys are great patriots.  They’re great people.  And they want to do something.  They’re going to do something.  And they’re going to do it, I think, quickly.  I think they want to see it., But we don’t want to have sick people having the right to have a gun.  Plus, when we see somebody is sick like this guy, when the police went to see him, they didn’t do a good job.  But they have restrictions on what they can do.  We got to give them immediate access to taking those guns away so that they don’t just leave and he’s sitting there with seven different weapons.  (Applause.)  Got to give immediate access., Don’t worry, you’re not going to get any — you won’t — don’t worry about the NRA.  They’re on our side.  You guys — half of you are so afraid of the NRA.  There’s nothing to be afraid of.  And you know what?  If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once and a while.  That’s okay.  They’re doing what they think is right.  I will tell you, they are doing what they think is right., But sometimes we’re going to have to be very tough and we’re going to have to fight them.  But we need strong background checks.  For a long period of time, people resisted that.  But now people, I think, are really into it., And John Cornyn — great guy — senator, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Kevin McCarthy hopefully are going to work on some legislation.  I hope you guys — they started already.  In fact, John has legislation in.  We’re going to strengthen it, we’re going to make it more pertinent to what we’re discussing, but he’s already started the process.  We’ve already started it.  And the other thing — we need hardened sites.  We have to have hardened sites., So just in concluding, we have tremendous things happening.  The country is doing well, and then we have a setback like this that’s so heart-wrenching.  It’s so heart-wrenching.  And we have to — we have to clean it up.  We have to straighten it out., You know, it’s wonderful that we’re setting records on the economy.  We’re setting records.  Black unemployment at an all-time historical low.  Hispanic unemployment at a historical low.  Women unemployment at an 18-year low — 18 years.  And actually, I did very well with women during the election.  Nobody wants to give me credit for that, as you know.  But — and I’m very proud of that.  To me, these are incredible statistics., And very importantly, we’re doing — our companies are doing well.  The fundamentals are beyond what — literally beyond what anyone has ever seen.  This isn’t a bubble.  You know, there was bubbles in the past because these companies were valued and nobody understood where — where’s their money?  Where’s the money?  And these are really strong companies we’re building now.  We have tremendous underlying value., I want to bring the steel industry back into our country.  If that takes tariffs, let them take tariffs, okay?  Maybe it will cost a little bit more, but we’ll have jobs.  Let it take tariffs.  I want to bring aluminum back into our country.  These plants are all closing or closed., Recently, we put a tariff on washing machines because we were getting killed, believe it or not, on washing machines and solar panels.  That was two months ago.  You have to see the activity on new plants being built for washing machines and for solar panels.  We had 32 solar-panel plants.  Of the 32, 30 were closed, and 2 were on life-to-life resuscitation.  They were dead., Now they’re talking about opening up many of them — reopening plants that have been closed for a long time.  And we make better solar panels than China.  One of their knocks were that their solar panels were lousy, they weren’t good.  We make a much higher-quality solar panel., So, after two months, we’re opening up at least five plants, and other plants are expanding on the washing machines — which, by the way, it sounds like, sort of, a little hokey to say washing machines.  It’s a big business.  It’s a very big business.  But then you look and you see, like — I won’t mention — I won’t mention countries.  I would never do that., But how many Chevrolets are in the middle of Berlin?  How many Fords are in the middle of Tokyo?  Not too many.  In fact, Ford, sort of, closed up their operation in Japan because they couldn’t get cars in there.  I spoke to Prime Minister Abe, another great friend of mine — he’s a great person — but I said, listen, you’re sending us millions of cars, and if we send you one and if we make it so perfect — they actually told me a case where they made this car so good.  This was — they spent a fortune.  They had the best environmental, the best this, the best skins, the best — everything you can have in a car.  The best safety.  They brought it in, and after inspections that lasted forever, it was rejected., You see, that’s a form of tariff, too.  Maybe that’s a more deadly form of tariff.  That, to me, is just as deadly as 50 percent, and 25 percent, and 100 percent — in many cases., So we’re going to straighten it out.  We’ve already started.  I mean, the first year is just — we laid the seeds.  You know, a lot of it is statutory, where you can’t do anything unless you go through a process.  Well, now, through our great team, we’ve gone through that process.  Many of the — in other words, you’ll do a rule, you have to wait 90 days.  That’s, sort of, what’s happening with the bump stocks.  I’m waiting for the next process, but it’s gone.  Just don’t worry about it.  It’s gone.  Essentially gone, because we’re going to make it so tough that you’re not going to be able to get them.  Nobody is going to want them anyway., You know, bump stocks — you shoot rapidly, but not accurately.  I don’t know if you have ever heard what a bump stock does.  The bullets come out fast, but you don’t know where the hell they’re going.  That’s why nobody even, really — too much — came to its defense.  But he used it in Las Vegas.  He was using bump stocks in Las Vegas, as you know.  So we’re getting rid of them., So you’re going to ask questions.  I’m going to help you folks.  We’re going to get all of the things that we want to do, whether it’s transportation, whether it’s safety, whether it’s law and order., One of the things that the past administration would not do is give this incredible equipment that we have — excess military equipment.  Wouldn’t give it to your police.  Would not give it to your law enforcement.  They didn’t like the idea — the administration — of armored vehicles.  I guess, maybe, they’d rather have — look, why wouldn’t they want that?  People were in danger, people were being killed, people were being shot, people were being hit with rocks during some bad times and some rough places., And we’ve given out hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of our excess military equipment to your police forces.  And I will tell you, every time I go to one of your cities, they come up to me — the police — and they say, “Thank you so much for that equipment.  We feel so much safer.”  Where they can go in an armored van up to a site and not worried about being shot or hit in the head with a rock.  And to me, it’s common sense.  But, you know, what can I tell you?  But I will say this: Your group really appreciates it., So with that, I’m going to ask Brian to say a couple of words and then we’ll go around, we’ll take some questions.  Maybe we’ll have Rick Scott come up second.  And I’m here as long as you need me.  Let’s get it all out.  We want to help the governors, we want to help our states, and we want to make our schools safe., Brian?  Please.  (Applause.), GOVERNOR SANDOVAL:  Mr. President, thank you.  And I truly appreciate you.  I appreciate all the members of the Cabinet.  On behalf of all the governors, I want to thank you for your hospitality and the First Lady’s hospitality yesterday evening.  It was an extraordinary night and truly a privilege to be able to visit and enjoy fellowship., Mr. President, I appreciate, again, your having us all today.  We can talk about issues with regard to infrastructure, workforce development, combatting opioids, prison reform, agriculture, healthcare, workforce — all these different issues. And those are things that we all need to talk about., But the issue of the day is school safety, is public safety, Mr. President.  You know, I shared this last night, Mr. President: After the massacre in Las Vegas — the mass shooting, where we lost 58 people, over 500 people were injured — this was a person who used those bump stocks.  And I personally want to thank you for taking action to eliminate those, because it, essentially, was a killing field down there, where we had 20,000 people who were simply helpless.  And that is an important first step., You mentioned, in your remarks, school safety and public safety.  And we need to have this national conversation with regard to what we’re going to do.  I suppose you were looking for some suggestions, some ideas, and it will come in the form of questions, as well., But I would suggest, Mr. President, with regard to the scope of the FBI background checks, if we could broaden those, Mr. President.  Because I know, in my state, our background states are much broader.  When we do an FBI background check, it does not include an adjudication of mental illness.  It does not include an adjudication of a domestic violence protection order or a conviction for domestic violence.  I think those are things that absolutely need to be included, and there are other categories that would be included in an expansion of FBI background checks., We talked about this at dinner, with regard to Governor Scott.  And again, my heart goes out to you and to the victims there in Florida, and Texas, and everywhere else where this has happened.  And we need to have this national conversation.  We need to bring the strength, the wisdom of all the governors and everyone else across the country to have this conversation., Something else that we have done in Nevada, with regard to school safety, is, I included in my budget more money for social workers in the schools.  We’ve had shootings where we’ve had bullied students that didn’t have access to resources at the schools, so now we have a social worker in every school.  So somebody come to that — Mr. President, we talked about that last night, and that’s something else that we can do., But again, having a room together like this, there’s no problem that we cannot solve.  Every one of us brings a unique experience that we can come to solve this problem.  You’re right, Mr. President — as a parent of a daughter who attends a middle school where there was simply a rumor that something could happen, and, one day later, half the school was absent — we can’t have parents living in fear.  We can’t have students living in fear.  They can’t teach, the kids can’t learn, and it’s just no way for our education system to operate., So I know that I’m going to offer my experience to you, Mr. President.  And I think I can speak for all the governors of the United States of America that we are here to solve this problem, once and for all.  You are right, we need to take action now.  The status quo is unacceptable., So, with that, God bless you, Mr. President.  God bless our great country.  Thank you.  (Applause.), GOVERNOR SCOTT:  Well, the first thing I want to do is I want to thank the President for making something happen.  All of us, as governors, know, in any jobs we’ve had, you have to get something done.  If you — anybody that has gone through one of these — and if you’ve gone to the funeral of a 14-year-old girl that her parents just loved her, you know that you have to make a change., So what we’ve done in the last — I guess, it’s a little less than two weeks — we’ve looked at what other governors have done.  We’ve brought people together.  I’m very appreciative of what the President has done by bringing us all together to talk about this, and also what he did last week by bringing people together because it has created momentum to make sure something happens this time, that we don’t go through this and nothing happen., So, in our state, the way I’ve done this is I’ve broken it down into three things.  Number one, we’re going to have school safety.  No parent in our state is going to say, “I’m concerned whether my child can go to school safely.”  If you go to school in Florida, you’re going to know that your child can come home safely.  If you’re a teacher, if you work at one of these schools, you’re going to know you’re going to come home safely.  That’s step one., We’re going to spend $500 million.  I have two weeks left in my legislative session; I’m not waiting for the federal government.  We’re going to invest $500 million, and we’re going to have significant law enforcement presence at every public school in our state., We’ve already been investing dollars in hardening our schools.  We’re not only going to invest a lot more state dollars, but we’re going to say any local dollars that go to capital outlay by our school districts, the first thing all those dollars have to be spent on is school hardening.  It’s the most important thing we can do, is harden these schools.  So we’re going to do it., And, by the way, the way it’s going to happen is our sheriffs are going to oversee how all the money is spent to make sure that the money is spent the right way.  There will be a plan annually, and the money will be spent the right way., Number two, mental illness.  We’re going to have mental health counselors in every school to make sure that all of our students can go through counseling or meet with a mental health counselor as often as they want.  We’re going to do it., We’re also going to have threat assessment teams.  Virginia did that after their shooting.  We’re going to have that in all of our schools, where you’ll have children, families, juvenile justice, teachers, principals, local law enforcement, all together, and say, “What are the threat assessments in our schools?”  And we’re going to do that., Next, we’re going to invest more dollars in mental health in our Children and Families Program.  We do that around our state, but we’re going to invest more dollars to make sure we have youth teams all around our state to help them., Finally, we’re not going to have — you’re not going to, in Florida, have access to a gun — if you struggle with mental illness, are you going to make violent threats — you’re not going to have access to a gun in our state.  You shouldn’t have access to a gun, and you’re not., So what we’re going to do is we’re going to have a violence threat restraining order that a family member, a mental health individual, or law enforcement can go to the court system — there will be due process — but they can make sure that you don’t have access to a gun., If you’ve been involuntarily committed because you’re a threat to yourself or others, you will not have access to a gun.  You’ll have to give those guns up.  There will be due process.  You can get those guns back, but we’re going to make sure that doesn’t happen., We’re going to make sure, as you do background checks, all this information is out there so we can make sure we know who has the guns., So, in our state, we are going to get all this done, and we’re going to get it done in the next two weeks.  I’ve been talking to my legislative leadership every day.  They’re committed to be a partner.  But in Florida, I want to make sure every parent knows that their child is going to come home safe and sound every day., Thank you, Mr. President.  (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Rick, and thank you, Brian, very much.  Great job you’ve done, too, as chairman.  Thank you., Okay.  Would you like to say — I think I can bring this over.  It might be easier just to pass this around., GOVERNOR IVEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Like you, I believe that the local officials have an awful lot of insight into what each school needs to provide public school safety.  So as I mentioned a little earlier to this group, Mr. President, I suggested that we give our local folks a list of things that they can do quickly, like limit the number of entrances that a school has to enter the building.  And then, equip every child above the 6th grade with a chip-activated card to enter that entrance., And also, you can consider putting in a metal detector at one or two or three entrances, since you’re limiting the number of entrances.  Also, a surveillance system.  And that surveillance system can be tied to the virtual Alabama Visual Center at the Education Department, so it’s instant information all at the same time., Certainly, training in mental health situation is fine, but for the immediate, I just think we need to give some guidance to our local people, and limit the access to entrancing, and equip with surveillance systems, metal detectors, or whatever they choose to do.  Where is the money coming from?  They’ve got some local money, but, in our state budget, there’s been a technology fund.  And a senator and I are working, and he introduced the bill last week, to be able to free up some of that money for use for school safety., So these are not costly things, but they are things that can be done immediately to improve school safety., THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you.  Thank you very  much, Kay., How about going around the room.  Anybody has some great ideas or suggestions?  Governor?, GOVERNOR INSLEE:  Thanks, Mr. President.  Two comments.  One from the state of Washington.  Thank you., We have a program called the Extreme Risk Protection Orders System that has been supremely effective in allowing family members that realize there’s a risk, to have them separated from their firearm.  It involves a judicial decision.  It involves a  hearing.  And it has saved lives, and I’m sure, in the state of Washington., And I would commend it to you for national attention, because it makes sure that when you have an uncle that might be — you have concern about depression — it allows law enforcement to separate your uncle, and depressed uncle, from his firearm.  If you have somebody in your family that might have some violent tendencies, after a hearing and a potential ex parte order, you get an order to actually allow law enforcement to remove them.  It’s been in operation for a year.  It’s been extremely successful.  I would commend it to you., ...]

       \n",
       "326  [Rose Garden, 1:47 P.M. EDT, THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I just want to say that we just spent quite a bit of time inside with the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been a friend of mine for a long time, long before my world of politics, early into his world of politics, I think. But we’ve been friends for a long time. We are probably now, despite what we read, we’re probably now — I think, at least as far as I’m concerned — closer than ever before. And the relationship is very good., We’re fighting for the same thing. We’re fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation. We’re fighting for tax reform, as part of that. We are getting close to healthcare. We’ll come up in the early- to mid-part of next year. We’re going to have a vote; I think we already have the votes. We feel confident we have the votes. We pretty much know what the plan is., I believe Republicans and Democrats are, as we speak, working together very hard, right now — working together to do an intermediate plan, a short-term plan, because Obamacare is a disaster. The rates have gone up. The premiums have gone up. The deductibles have gone through the roof. I mean, it’s terrible. If you look at the deductibles, unless you really have a problem, you’re not going to be able to use them., So we have been working together long and hard. We think we’re in good shape for the budget, we hope. And we hope to be in good shape with, again, the largest tax cuts ever passed in this country. It’s going to spur business. You look at other countries, what they’ve done — and we’re competing with other countries. When China is at 15 percent, when I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their cooperate rates down to 8 percent from 12. But you have other countries also reducing. We can’t be at 35 percent and think we’re going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs. So we worked on that., I was very honored to see a man that I’ve had a lot of respect for, James Lee Witt, of the Clinton administration — the head of FEMA. He gave us an A-plus; I just see — it just came out. And I’ve always had respect for him. He gave us — he’s the FEMA director of the Clinton administration — gave us an A-plus for how we responded to the hurricane aftermath — all of the hurricanes. And that includes Puerto Rico., So I just want to thank Mr. Witt, wherever you may be now, wherever you may be listening. I just want to say, I really much appreciate it. Because that took it out of politics — out of the world of politics, in that he was with the Clinton administration and I’m sure remains loyal to the Clinton administration. I hope he does., So just to finish off, my relationship with this gentleman is outstanding, has been outstanding. We are working very hard to get the tax cuts. We will continue to work hard to get the healthcare completed. I’m going to be surprising some people with an economic development bill later on, but I haven’t even told Mitch because I want to focus on tax cuts and some other things right now., One of the unspoken elements that we discussed at lunch — and it just is not talked about — yes, we got a great justice, Justice Gorsuch, into the United States Supreme Court. He is going to be outstanding, hopefully for many, many years. But something that people aren’t talking about is how many judges we’ve had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges. We have — tremendous — right now under review; the Democrats are holding them up beyond anything — beyond comprehension, they’re holding them up., I mean, frankly, they have terrible, terrible policy — terrible policy — and perhaps they’re not even good politicians, but they are good at obstruction. So I looked at some of these numbers, between the judges — and I want to say that we will set records in terms of the number of judges., And if you read the Wall Street Journal, I have to give them a little bit of a — a person, a writer, I won’t mention names — but you can see who has really been a really fair person — wrote an article or wrote an editorial, in a sense, saying how well we’re doing with judges and appointments. I think it’s one of the big unsung things of this administration, in addition to the fact that we have had a lot of legislation passed on the VA and lots of other things., But the judge story is an untold story. Nobody wants to talk about it. But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out. So numerous have been approved. Many, many are in the pipeline. The level of quality is extraordinary., And I just wanted to say that we’re working very closely on that also, and getting really great reviews from those people and, in many cases, some scholars that have been studying it. There has never been anything like what we’ve been able to do together with judges., So with that, I’d like to have Mitch say a few words, and if you want to do a little question-and-answer, we can do that also., Thank you very much. Thank you., LEADER MCCONNELL: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to underscore what the President said. We have the same agenda. We’ve been friends and acquaintances for a long time. We talk frequently. We don’t give you a readout every time we have a conversation. But frequently we talk on the weekends about the issues that are before us., Obviously passing a budget, which enables tax reform and tax reduction comes next, then a supplemental to take adequate care of those who have been harmed by the natural disasters we’ve been afflicted with lately. And, of course, the Senate’s unique role — it seems to be a lot of people forget — we’re in the personnel business. There are 1,200 of the President’s nominations subject to confirmation in the Senate. The House is not in the personnel business. We are., The single-most significant thing this President has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But it’s not just the Supreme Court. There are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level, as the President has indicated, of young, conservative — and when we say conservative about a judge, what we’re talking about here are, the kind of the people the President is appointing to the courts believe that the role of a judge is to try to rule based upon what the law says, not what they hoped the outcome would be., Justice Scalia used to say, if the judge is not occasionally unhappy with the conclusion he reached, he’s not a very good judge. Or as Justice Gorsuch put it down in my state a couple of weeks ago, judges don’t wear red, they don’t wear blue — they wear black., And those are the kind of people the President is sending up to the Senate to be confirmed. Many of them, as he pointed out, are younger and will be on the bench for a long time, and have a great deal to do with what kind of country we’re going to have far into the future., Legislatively, obviously the top priority is tax reduction. And I think what the President and I would both like to say to you today, contrary to what some of you may have reported: We are together totally on this agenda to move America forward., THE PRESIDENT: John., Q Mr. President, in terms of the timetable for tax reform, the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, has said he wants to get it done by the end of this year. He would make the House stay through the Christmas break in order to get it done. The Senate Majority Leader has said we’ll get it done this Congress. Would you be okay if tax reform were not passed until next year as opposed to this year?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would like to see it be done this year, John. I would like very much to see it be done this year. So we won’t go a step further. If we get it done, that’s a great achievement., But don’t forget it took years for the Reagan administration to get taxes done. I’ve been here for nine months, a little more than nine months. I can say the same thing for healthcare. If you look at Obama — first of all, if you look at Clinton, they weren’t able to get it done. If you look at other administrations, they weren’t able to get it done. President Obama, after a long period of time, was able to finally push it through, but pushed through something that’s now failed — really failing badly. But again, we’re meeting — Democrat, Republican are meeting right now, and right now they’re working on something very special., But I have to tell you, I really believe that we have a very good chance, and I think Mitch feels the same way, of getting the taxes done, hopefully fairly long before the end of the year. That’s what we’d like to see., Go ahead., LEADER MCCONNELL: Let me just add to what the President said. The goal is to get it done this calendar year. But it is important to remember that Obama signed Obamacare in March of year two. Obama signed Dodd-Frank in July of year two. We’re going to get this job done, and the goal is to get it done by the end of the year., THE PRESIDENT: And just to finish up for Mitch — and we’re nine months, right? So we could have a long way to go, but that’s okay., Yes., Q Thank you very much. Do you both have confidence in Representative Tom Marino to be your drug czar? And on healthcare, in your recent (inaudible), you said, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that after hearing repeal and replace for seven years, he failed. That should never have happened.” Do you still (inaudible)?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, let’s go to the second part of your question, with Mitch. Again, we’ve been doing healthcare for, really, seven months, and probably six months, if you think about it, because we started in probably a total of six months. Others were 2.5 years, and much more than that. Others were eight years, and they didn’t get it passed. This man is going to get it done, and I think get it done long before anybody else, and I think it’s going to be a great healthcare., As far as Tom Marino, so he was a very early supporter of mine — the great state of Pennsylvania. He’s a great guy. I did see the report. We’re going to look into the report and we’re going to take it very seriously. Because we’re going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem. And I want to get that absolutely right. This country — and, frankly, the world — has a drug problem. The world has a drug problem. But we have it, and we’re going to do something about it., So I’m going to have a major announcement on that problem next week. We’re going to be looking into Tom., Q Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News Network. I’d like to ask you: Do you support the plan by people who previously served in your administration, such as the Steve Bannon, to primary Republican candidates in the 2018 elections who do not support your agenda?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have a very good relationship, as you know, with Steve Bannon. Steve has been a friend of mine for a long time. I like Steve a lot. Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing. Some of the people that he may be looking at, I’m going to see if we talk him out of that, because, frankly, they’re great people., What Mitch will tell you is that maybe, with the exception of a few — and that is a very small few — I have a fantastic relationship with the people in the Senate, and with the people in Congress. I mean, I have a — with our House of Representatives. I have a great relationship with political people. If you read the papers, you think — I’m like on one island and they’re like on the other. Well, it’s not the way it is., We have a fantastic relationship. I’m friends with most of them, I can say. And I don’t think anybody could have much of a higher percentage. But I’m friends with most of them. I like and respect most of them, and I think they like and respect me., Just so you understand, the Republican Party is very, very unified. When we get things approved, we have to go through hell because we have no Democrat support, we have nobody. We don’t have a vote from the Democrats. As an example: massive tax cuts — we may not get any Democrat votes. Now, we also may get three of four, but we may get no — for massive tax cuts. We’re the highest-taxed country in the world, and yet we may get no Democrat support. And that’s because they’re obstructionists and they just basically want us to do badly, but that’s not going to happen., Yes, go ahead., Q On the opioid crisis, I listened to you on the campaign trail talk about that repeatedly. You said you watched the “60 Minutes” report last night. Number one, do you want to reverse the law that Congressman Marino helped pass that DEA whistleblowers say has contributed to the expansion of the opioid crisis?, THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to look at that very closely., Q And does his sponsorship of that law in any way undermine your confidence in him as drug czar?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, he’s a good man. I have not spoken to him, but I will speak to him and I’ll make that determination. And if I think it’s one percent negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change, yes., Q Mr. McConnell —, Q Mr. President —, THE PRESIDENT: One second. Yes., Q What about declaring a written national emergency for this crisis? You’ve talked about it but you haven’t put that piece of paper together., THE PRESIDENT: We are going to be doing that next week. By the way, you know that’s a big step. By the way, people have no understanding of what you just said. That is a very, very big statement. It’s a very important step. And to get to that step, a lot of work has to be done and it’s time-consuming work. We’re going to be doing in next week, okay?, Q Did you have a chance, during your lunch today, to discuss the comments that Steve Bannon made this weekend? And what do you make of those comments, declaring war on the Republican Party, declaring war on you?, LEADER MCCONNELL: Look, you know, the goal here is to win elections in November. Back in 2010 and 2012, we nominated several candidates — Christine O’Donnell, Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock. They’re not in the Senate. And the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election., My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority. The way you do that is not complicated. You have to have nominate people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home. We changed the business model in 2014; we nominated people who could win everywhere. We took the majority in the Senate. We had one skirmish in 2016; we kept the majority in the Senate. So our operating approach will be to support our incumbents and, in open seats, to seek to help nominate people who can actually win in November. That’s my approach and that’s the way you keep a governing majority., Q Mr. President, earlier today you criticized drug companies and also insurance companies, saying that drug companies were charging prices that are too high —, THE PRESIDENT: Yes., Q — and insurance companies were taking government money —, THE PRESIDENT: Exactly right., Q What specifically would you like to see both of those types of companies do?, THE PRESIDENT: So the insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare — an absolute fortune. As you know, what I did with the cuts at the end, which were all going — you know, you’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a month going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I’m very happy with what I did., And because of that, people are talking now. Democrats are talking to the Republicans for a short-term taking care of, what we will call, healthcare so that people can have good healthcare without a big spike. You would have had massive spikes — you already have. I mean, every year the massive spikes to Obamacare have been ridiculous., As far as — and I didn’t speak to Mitch about this today, but a priority of mine — and you know that this is coming up — will be the cost of prescription drugs. We are going to get the costs way down, way down, and those drugs companies — so you have the insurance companies, in the one case; in the other case — actually, with regard to both, you have the drug companies., They contribute massive amounts of money to political people — I don’t know, Mitch, maybe even to you. But I have to tell you, they contribute massive amounts of money. Me, I’m not interested in their money. I don’t need their money. I will tell you, you have prescription drugs — you go to England, you go to various places, Canada — you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything, is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the United States., We are going to get drug prices — prescription drug prices way down because the world has taken advantage of us. The world has taken advantage of us when that happens, so that’s going to be very important., Q Thank you. On healthcare, there are about 6 million people that get subsidies to help pay for Obamacare — about 70 percent, by one study of a couple of states that you won in November —, THE PRESIDENT: Yeah., Q Now that you’ve cut off these payments, are you going to ensure that those people will still get help from the federal government to pay —, THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s what we’re looking to do, Joe. We want to get it down so that people can have affordable healthcare. Look, you look at some states — 116 percent up. In Alaska, over 200 percent up. In other states, 50 percent, 70 percent up, and those are some of the states that are doing better. Obamacare is a wreck, it’s a mess, it’s destroying lives. We want to get it in those states — the states that I did so well in — but also in states that I didn’t win., I want to get healthcare that’s much more affordable and much better healthcare, and that’s what we’re doing., Yes., Q Let me ask you about tax reform., THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead — tax reform., Q Yes, tax reform. You had said the other day that there were some adjustments being made., THE PRESIDENT: Yeah., Q Gary Cohn said today that there would be some things that are negotiable. What exactly, in your eyes, is negotiable? And then, for the Leader, you said that the top priority is tax reduction — you did not say tax reform — in 2017, Leader McConnell. So can you commit specifically to tax reform in 2017? For the both of you., THE PRESIDENT: So we are doing minor adjustments. We want to make sure that the middle class is the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts and tax reform. And that’s, I’m sure, what Mitch meant also, because people get it confused., We are doing massive tax cuts. We’re also doing simplification and reform. Simplification, where, literally, if we can do it on page; now, in some cases, it may be two pages. But we’re doing major simplification. We’re bringing the categories down from — if you include zero, because there are zero — we’re bringing it from eight to four. That’s a big, big simplification, just that alone., But we are doing the massive cuts. And I will say this: Wherever I’ve been, this has been so popular with the people. Now we have to get a couple of additional people to raise their hands., Mitch., LEADER MCCONNELL: Yeah, I agree with the President, it’s about both reduction and reform. It’s been 30 years since this kind of effort was undertaken successfully, and we’re going to succeed this time. The bills, the details of them, will be written by the Ways and Means and Finance Committees after we approve the budget. And obviously, the budget opens the path to tax reform. But it’s a both — it’s about both — about both reform and reduction., Q Why haven’t we heard anything from you so far about the Soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that?, THE PRESIDENT: I’ve written them personal letters. They’ve been sent, or they’re going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend. I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families — because I have done that, traditionally. I felt very, very badly about that. I always feel badly. It’s the toughest — the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It’s a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day — it’s a very, very tough day. For me, that’s by far the toughest., So, the traditional way — if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn’t make calls, a lot of them didn’t make calls. I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice., So, generally, I would say that I like to call. I’m going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I’m going to be calling them. I have — as you know, since I’ve been President, I have., But in addition, I actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers we’re talking about, and they’re going to be going out either today or tomorrow., Yes., Q General Kelly said just last week that you believe that Cuba could stop the attacks against Americans. Do you believe them, that Cuba is — do you believe Cuba is responsible?, THE PRESIDENT: I think Cuba knew about it, sure. I do believe Cuba is responsible. I do believe that. And it’s a very unusual attack, as you know, but I do believe Cuba is responsible, yes., Q Roy Moore, down in Alabama, has said that he believes homosexuality should be illegal and that Muslims should be barred from serving in the U.S. Congress. What makes you comfortable with someone with those beliefs serving in the U.S. Senate? And the same question to you, Mr. Leader., THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to be meeting with Roy sometime next week, and we’re going to talk to him about a lot of different things. But I’ll be meeting with him., He ran a very strong race. The people of Alabama, who I like very much and they like me very much, but they like Roy. And we’ll be talking to him, and I can report to you then. Okay?, Go ahead., Q Mr. President, this is a question for you and for Leader McConnell following up on your comments on the budget. One of the issues outstanding right now is what the Senate Judiciary Committee will (inaudible) of blue slips. I’m wondering what your position is, Mr. President, and what your position is, Leader McConnell. Because, you know, (inaudible) that right now gives Democrats leverage over the appointments., LEADER MCCONNELL: I can give you my position. The blue slip, for those of you who are not familiar with it, is a custom determined by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And Senator Grassley can give you his view of how he views this. I’ll give you my view., My view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge is simply a notification of how you’re going to vote. To conclude otherwise would have left us in the following position at the beginning of this Senate. Forty-eight Democratic senators would have been able to blackball 62 percent of the circuit judge nominees. That’s simply not a tenable place to land in a Senate that now deals with judges with a simple majority., So my own personal view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge should simply be a notification of how you intend to vote., THE PRESIDENT: We could talk blue slips, but my attitude is I just want really capable people going to the courts., Peter., Q Mr. President, in 2012 you tweeted that “Obama’s complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS,” in your words, “since he had full control for two years.” You wrote, “He can never take responsibility.” But today, you’ve said about some of the challenges right now in Congress and in Washington, “I’m not going to blame myself, I’ll be honest. They’re not getting the job done.” So what’s different then than now?, THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just explain what’s different. We have nominations pending right now, and we have 182 approved — if you look at this: the number that he had approved was 65 percent and 70 percent, and we have 39 percent. They’re holding up every single nomination., Q How about the agenda broadly?, ...]

       "327  [James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, 1:43 P.M. EST, MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thanks for coming., Last night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court.  It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia.  As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing., In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles., During his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators — including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy — were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006., With as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate., Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia., Judge Gorsuch’s academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship., Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text.  He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the — he believes — sorry, I almost screwed that one up — (laughter) — he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings.  He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background., And I would note, I think — and I always want to caveat this — but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the — as someone he clerked for on the bench.  So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate., Now, on to the issues of the day.  Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month.  The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room.  The meeting also included some of the administration’s African American appointees., Later today, the President will issue a proclamation.  The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 — excuse me, 1994 and 2004.  President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon., At events throughout this entire month, we’ll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders — from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas.  African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that., Continuing with today’s schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night.  On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell.  And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner., With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it’s a good time to talk about the confirmation process.  Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster.  They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified.  And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment., Also this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, including David O’Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center;, \\nWayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute., President Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President.  He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law., The attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign.  They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote.  The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor., The President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson.  Mr. Tillerson’s tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination., Later this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  So far, between the Vice President and staff, we’ve had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the President’s nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court., Now, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination process.  Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where I’m going with that:  Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the President’s attempts to make America great again., Just today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present.  Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt’s hearing.  They’re doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics.  The President’s Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote., In other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today.  We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General., Additionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — designee — is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon.  And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon., A few more things before I open it up for questions., \\nIn terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House.  The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady.  Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon., A few personnel announcements.  Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate:  Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General., On another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the President’s executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry.  I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject.  For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking.  A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent — which is a clear majority — of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat., A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country.  And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President’s top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he’s taking to keep our country safe., Further, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the President’s decision to take our national security so seriously.  The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the “structural problems” faced by these nations., I know that there was a question on Monday regarding Iran’s firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel.  I’d like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update., GENERAL FLYNN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran’s destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East., The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.  These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea., In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms.  The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk., President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.  Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice., Thank you., MR. SPICER:  Thanks, General.  We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff — NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room.  Further details will be provided on that subject.  So thank you, General, with that., As we start off, I mentioned yesterday I’m pleased that we’ve expanded the briefing room — at least virtually.  And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I’m pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island., Kim., Q    Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me okay?, MR. SPICER:  We can., Q    Great.  Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city.  As we know, President Trump’s executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them.  What I’m wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list, and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?, MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Kim.  I think the President’s goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear.  We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe.  The goal is to make sure on two fronts.  One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that.  Furthermore, the President has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities., As we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we’ll have further updates on how we tend to — on how that list will come out and when it will come out.  So I look forward to following up on that as well., \\nWith that, David Jackson., Q    David isn’t here but I’ll ask a question.  (Laughter.), MR. SPICER:  Go for it.  (Laughter.), Q    Maybe he’s on Skype?  (Laughter.), Q    The President’s daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing.  Can you tell me how that differs at all from the PDB?  Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally, and who is giving it to him?, MR. SPICER:  He did receive an intelligence briefing today.  Congressman — or Director Pompeo was here.  General Flynn, his national security advisor, his briefer.  So he receives an intelligence briefing and the PBD every day., Q    Is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the PDB?, MR. SPICER:  I think it is a more comprehensive — again, I think — we went through this during the transition period, right?  There is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis, and I think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials.  But every single day, he does receive the PBD.  And then I think, on top of that, he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team., Q    But the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every day?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I can get back to you on that.  He does get the PBD every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team, yes., Q    Two quick questions., MR. SPICER:  We’re not going to do this again., Q    On Black History Month., MR. SPICER:  Yeah., Q    Is President Obama being invited to any of the Black History Month celebrations?, MR. SPICER:  Not that I’m aware of.  It’s day one.  We just started it off.  We’ll have to get back to you on further details.  I think —, Q    And if I may —, MR. SPICER:  We have a lot — there’s a lot of activities, as I mentioned, that the President is going to do to celebrate and honor this month.  And this was just the first day of the month of February., Q    And today he made the comment about Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more.  Do you have any idea what specifically he was referring to?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s contribution — I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made.  And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he’s going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more., Kristen., Q    Thank you.  Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by “we’re putting Iran on notice?”, MR. SPICER:  Well, as I mentioned, I think General Flynn and the NSC staff will have a briefing at 4:00 p.m.  They can go forward.  I’m not going to — I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that — their actions were both provocative and a violation, and making sure that they understood that we weren’t going to sit by and not act on those actions., Q    Are you building the case to —, MR. SPICER:  I’m just — I’m not going to go any further than that, Kristen., Q    Okay, then let me ask you about — let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings.  How does the President plan to get Chuck Schumer onboard with his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, when he has referred to him as a “clown” and accused him of fake tears?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think those are two things.  I think we’re going to — you look at the support that’s already come out.  I think there’s eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications.  And not just the Senate but I mean you look at the widespread support that came out for Judge Gorsuch last night across the spectrum.  No matter your philosophical view of the Court, I think his qualifications for the Court, his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified person., And so it’s not just Chuck Schumer; I think the rest of the Senate as he goes up there — but I think the interesting thing —, Q    Sure —, MR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on.  I understand that.  And I think Chuck Schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the Cabinet that he’s more interested in politics than actually moving the government along.  And I think that is troubling., I would ask you that — I think that the question needs to be asked to Chuck Schumer:  Why are you stalling all of these nominees?  Why are you insisting on new requirements that you didn’t assume for Sotomayor or Kagan?  I mean, there’s a point at which they need to get asked, why are they obstructing government at every step of the way?  There’s an element to which they need to be held accountable as well.  They held certain standards in place for their nominees, both for the bench and for the Cabinet.  And the question is, are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on Republicans when they had nominees in a Democratic White House., Q    But does the President think that by personally insulting Chuck Schumer that’s a way to get —, MR. SPICER:  But again, Kristen, I think the goal is to get — when — but again, I would go back.  Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this.  There’s a lot of comments that he’s made and a lot of accusations that he’s thrown out there and a lot of politics that he’s played.  At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words., Blake., Q    Sean, the President today invoked the possibility on the Supreme Court, Sean, of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option.  If it gets to that point, is the White House comfortable with that path?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President made clear his goal today, which is, number one, he believes that Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated — not only confirmed, but done so with a large bipartisan vote.  As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the Obama administration, and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy, definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did so., I think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the Democrats used when they had nominees up.  But I think the President made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down, but also that it is ultimately up to Senator McConnell and how he wants to operate this., John Gizzi., Q    Thank you, Sean.  Just one question today.  Leading up to Judge Gorsuch’s announcement last night and him coming out after, there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to Washington., MR. SPICER:  No, actually, John, he didn’t.  That was media — that was misreporting.  My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  So with all due respect, I can’t be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here.  He never was at the White House.  My understanding is he had a meeting in eastern Pennsylvania with another judge.  But it was — and, again, I’m not — I don’t track his whereabouts, but my understanding is he never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania yesterday.  So it was — we announced when we were going to make this announcement.  I think it was a phenomenal way to introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and the United States Senate.  We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Unfortunately, none of them showed up.  But it was an opportunity for them and the American people to see an amazing choice that the President made for the bench., Anita., Q    My question, Sean, my question is —, MR. SPICER:  You said one, John., Q    But I didn’t ask the question.  My question is simply this:  With the support that he received, the people who called the President, would it be safe to say that Judge Hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon — say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end of the term?, MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government.  He’s an impressive, impressive jurist.  Obviously the four that really made that final list for the President were unbelievably impressive.  So I don’t want to get in front of the President., \\nHopefully he continues to have the President’s support and is someone that the President was unbelievably impressed with.  So we’ll have to see what vacancies come down the pipe., Anita., Q    I know you love when we say we have two questions.  I do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top.  First, you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the Department of Justice.  Why are they being nominated now, before Senator Sessions is there?  Is it because there’s a lack of people?  Was he consulted?  Or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney general?, MR. SPICER:  It’s the normal process of getting those — I’ve mentioned at a few briefings — the deputies, the unders, and the actings are in the pipeline.  We announced one the other day for Homeland.  We’ve got Commerce was previously announced.  And so this is just a continuation of the process to fill —, Q    So would then Senator Sessions — I mean, in speaking with him —, \\nMR. SPICER:  Of course.  These are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of, 100 percent., Q    Okay.  And then the second question was, you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley Davidson executives.  There’s reporting that he was supposed to go to Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to.  That was canceled because of the company.  Can you talk about that?, MR. SPICER:  I just think — look, it was easier for the executives to come here, considering the week and all of the activity that’s been going on.  And we figured the easiest thing to do was — again, no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing.  We looked at different options and, ultimately, the easiest thing to do in accordance with the President’s schedule was to invite them here to Washington to talk about some of the stuff that we’ve been doing., Q    Are you worried about protesting?, ...]
